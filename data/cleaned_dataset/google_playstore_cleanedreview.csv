1,i cannot open the app anymore
1,i have been begging for a refund from this app for over a month and nobody is replying me
1,very costly for the premium version approx indian rupees 910 per year better to download the premium version of this app from apkmos website and use it microsoft to do list app is far more better
1,used to keep me organized but all the 2020 updates have made a mess of things  y cudnt u leave well enuf alone  guess ur techies feel the need to keep making changes to justify continuing to collect their salary  
1,dan birthday oct 28
1,it has changed how i viewed my different lists now they are all jumbled together and i cant find what i need
1,im only looking for a grocery list app but every time i tap away from the app i have to tap again after opening it again to see the list i cant find a way to keep a certain list showing when i open or reopen the app eta in response to the reply it doesnt work like that on my phone even if the grocery list is showing when i open another app and then go back to the anydo app the list of lists is showing and i have to retap to get the grocery list to show again
1,reset my free trial new phone id like to see if its better
1,how do to stop monthly payment because i dont use this app anymore
1,i complain about not crashes and it was immediately fixedgood job now the crashes have returned i really need it fixed because i need to change apps otherwise  i followed your instructions on deleting the data etc but it just now crashed again i am a patient person and i have used any do for years but lets try one more time and then i will have to find another app it crashed again 
1,constant crashing after reading all the negative reviews i uninstalled it from all my devices canceled subscription app was great until it crashed after spending more than a hour setting it up on my samsung tablet it will not run cannot even get it to start too bad in the past my experiences have been good with this app guess i will see how long it takes to crash on my cell phone so much for multidevice sync such a disappointment see above for new comment added
1,widgets are useless because they always show all tasks i have regardless of category theres no option to show only a specific category like groceries so theyre all mixed up with todo list tasks do developers even care about usability isnt it a software design 101
1,horrible app it doesnt do as described absolutely no support
1,update october 2020 new update deleted all of my tasks forced me to create an account and now only bare minimum is free finding a new app been using this for years and loved it with each update you get less and less free it just auto updated and now i cant have reoccurring reminders without paying unless you count defaulting to every monday it wouldnt even allow me to update a long time weekly reminder
1,did not realize there was a charge for this app do not want this app
1,spams notifications of how many tasks other users have completed this week who on earth would care uninstalled update developer responded that this was a once off experiment i think this was actually the third time i received this notification also experimental spam is still spam
1,downloaded first thing it trys to do is do a con not impressed
1,no longer works with alexa what happened
1,it doesnt show any list
1,do not download
1,this app is not what i wanted at all
1,unnecessary pop up really annoying and counterproductive
1,they recently started sending spammy notifications every week or so please stop
1,shows tasks assigned to others in widget a major missing feature for any serious projects is some way to know if a task youre currently adding to a long list already exists some kind of an automatic search through the existing tasks  at least the tasks in the current list  while typing in a new task other than that this is great good job _task search in the web app is an extra step and not intuitive_ using a separate search feature to check every new task youre adding is absurd
1,7 days for free and then you pay plus too complicated for some simple tasks
1,update thanks for your response i would ask the developers to check their own app there is no monthly subscription option in the app old review no monthly subscriptions why should i be forced to subscribe for a year i am definitely not subscribing for a year in one go this is ridiculously desperate
1,expensive paywall preventing access to features in wanting to try out
1,i was about to pay for this app when i noticed a bug it does not effectively sync tasks and events from the google calendar numerous issues and you cant even mark those events as over sorry not going to subscribe to this i have no idea why this app is so famous its quite bad in my opinion
1,worst application no task information on screen
1,i downloaded this app to try for my task list but i see therere not many functions choices of sounds color labels to make the task fun dissapointed with the score i saw on google play the worst point is this app forced me to pay for it without any awareness i checked my google play account before the trial end i didnt see any subscription plan from anydo but after the trial it charged me yearly plan for this app bad way to trick people to pay for this app
1,shameless app ever waste money  i have subscribed and have been charged for the whole year though no features of premium appeared can someone clarify the reason
1,i am not providing email addresses or google or facebook accounts for a todo list
1,uninstalled it as soon as it started sending me ad notifications why does any developer think this is acceptable disgusting
1,i have subscribed and have been charged for the whole year though no features of premium appeared can someone clarify the reason
1,have to pay premium if you want to put multiple reminders a day

1,i was trying for days to un subscribe but of course that i was charged absolutely no support horrible and disgusting tactics
1,update ruined app last update reformatted the plan my day function so the ability to schedule tasks for that day or postpone into the future is unusable so i have 50 tasks and to way to arrange them into a comprehensive order contacted the developer who emailed me back after 4 days asking for a screenshot of the problem so i sent it right back 3 days later  no response from the developer no fix nothing update98 no fix moved to acaltasks 
1,does not do weekly reminders correctly i opened a bug report and was told that it was a known bug a reminder app that gets reminders at the wrong time is a big no from me
1,in app purchases significantly impact experience 16 a year for features such as recurring tasks youre having a laugh

1,why is this so buggy now why are you no longer really being attentive to quality control cant delete task on one try can no longer delete finished tasks without several attempts all commands are hesitant all commands require multiple attempts i have emailed you 3 times with no response please advise
1,hum hai al ghj
1,shabab
1,makes simple things extremely complicated
1,even after your response it doesnt change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed the reasoning that others do it is negligible only way i would rate this app better is if you had an anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in
1,the latest update now not working fine at all its worsening day by day the developers now appears to have a different intention that premium paid version is purchased by the users
1,just use your basic phone calendar
1,i want to cancel the subscription
1,moneygrabber wants you to pay premium to choose specific dates
1,does not do much different than google tasks which is easier to use and is free as a result i wanted a refund as i only realized this after my 7 day trial refunds are only given within 24 hours of their drawing their fee not sure that is legal for an automatic subscription after app trial
1,bekaar bagwas time waste useless and asking for payment before use anyway
1,useless app set up 8 reminders during a course of 4 days and not once received any notification waste of money
1,subscription
1,this app met my needs until this latest update dislike the new format to such a degree that its a dealbreaker now i have to start from scratch researching apps to find a replacement i know i used the free version so you dont care if i go but this is such a disappointment
1,it syncs everything terrible you have to get the pro version in order to be able to do anything actually worth while
1,i dont found usefulness
1,in the calendar of anydo 1st of august is marked as bakrid but 22nd august is not marked as ganesha chaturthi is there a specific reason or was it conveniently forgotten developer please do respond because it depends on your response whether to buy it or not
1,its a good app but the app keeps crashing when i allow this app to add to my calendar after adding it to calendar then yhis app doesnt open keeps crashing
1,saying free and simple is not telling people it is a 7 day free trial especially at google play store and people only know its a 7 day free trial after they download it so why wont google do anything about this app developers not mention their apps have a trial period which results in people downloading apps for nothing ps 95 of the app is free until the trial period finishes
1,scam premium that bypasses googleplay on the mobile app you can only buy 1 year of premium while on the website a monthly payment is possible people buy the monthly more often and the developer listed it on its personal website only to bypass google fee thus i need to link my card on their site too
1,this new layout is just awful just ridiculously awful i cannot in any way fathom how this got a thumbs up from anybody bye bye anydo im off to download something that wasnt designed by a nine year old
1,you have to open an account with them i wont be going there would be nice to be given the choice
1,there is no option to delete the account if i dont find this app useful you guyz will keep my data this is against the policies and norms

1,automatically shows the reminder snackbar when i open other apps without me setting it up what kind of violation is this stop bugging your users unsolicitedly uninstalled
1,i love this app but i do have one major gripe  i want an option to buy premium once even at a higher price and not as a monthly or yearly subscription edit  very unhappy with developer response to pricing i want to buy premium for this great product they made but its not a service this isnt netflix youre going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model
1,atleast make a few features available  if the customer donot like the app at initial stage than how would heshe ever think about going premium

1,good improvements but still dont have nag or presisitent reminders i missing a lot reminders accidentally

1,there is some issue in payment
1,too complicated i need a plan to plan tasks
1,everything it expects you to pay
1,this app is useless unless you make the monthly payment in that case does exist other app free and only with the essential
1,too many features locked behind premium
1,worst app
1,i have the same recurring tasks to do every day i need a todolist reminder to buzz me when its time the problem with this app is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day giving me different times the next day that is an annoying fail screw it im going elsewhere if i find a better app ill let you guys know update  suggestion did not work and i found an app that does not drift i have moved on
1,omg the ui is awful seriously you have popup for premium every 2 seconds theres no intuitive way see a normal calendar you have to create an account even if you dont want to the app is beautiful but show screen where its impossible to understand what you have to do its a calendar show a f calendar
1,not good
1,trash yes it has some nice nifty features but it lacks in complete necessities to actually plan your day you can make a task perfectly include subtasks and then add a nice color to the task but no yellow because thats already the fixed color of the priority label reminders are great except you can only have one if i want to have a reminder on wednesday 10am and a reminder on friday 6pm id need a different app because this app only allows you to set 1 reminder frustrating 010
1,is it necessary to sign up account while making a new account its shows error oops try again later
1,ive been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird i dont receive reminders anymore and its completely a waste of time to set reminders not very reliable right now

1,raben nat s7
1,first thing that happened upon opening is asking for payment good job
1,i do not have much to say in regards to the app itself it seems to function fine but it was not the calendar app that i needed the reason i am giving it 1 star is because i canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate the problem has been reported to the company i will keep this review updated with any action from anydo update the gist of the problem is this anydo makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub
1,unable to register with an email clickingcontinue with email will just take you to a login page complete waste of time i searched them first three pages of google for a solution and found nothing found no solution on their help section i dont want to register with facebook or google if you include a feature make sure it actually works
1,my backup is gone very important data deleted
1,anyforget had an instance of daily repeating event that i have marked as complete today and somehow it did skip the next day and only proceeded to the day after kind of daily event with some days skipped so useless to me as cant be trusted for notifying about daily routine tasks ps dont tell me i dont know how to setup a recurring event
1,it works okay but i did not consent to subscribing at 28year subscription i thought i purchased it until i saw that it was renewed for an additional 28 its definitely not worth that price very angry and ripped off i got charged twice for something that i thought i bought outright i will never buy anything from them ever
1,very slow app it took me 10 min just to start the app
1,updates made that are not fully tested they need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison that was simple to use but most importantly it worked
1,anydo
1,app loding ke baad peese maang raha hai pahle bataaye  data kyo kharaab karwaya
1,ruined the app by trying to get too fancy my wife has also become frustrated with it she has had it since it started and now struggles with it you should be able to add a task then go straight to set timeday but instead you have all the other short cuts there that really arent

1,bad app
1,tried doing all the settings as per ur guidence but app is not supporting popups in lock screen everytime i have to unlock my screen to check the event
1,this is an overengineered list keeping app that i hate i kept it for years in spite of that because i was in the ecosystem but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance no i dont need it to take thirty seconds to boot up my grocery list so that your algorithm can tell me how to most productively plan my day by sorting my grocery list in order of the order i entered each item i do not need an anydo minute
1,kimhong
1,i hate this app  as soon as i downloaded it my phone was hanging  
1,monthly fee for dark mode really i could accept a one time payment for such a feature but not monthly
1,no grocery widget ridiculous the task widget is confusing i just want to be able to add stuff simply on the fly
1,this app has malware
1,not happy app just asked me to sign in and now has deleted all my previous reminders i had reminders set up for throughout the rest of this year and now i dont know what they were youve put me off using your app now whats the point if its not reliable
1,not making an account
1,i was a customer of anydo for a while and on march 2020 i clearly asked them not to renew my subscription as i found a different company to provide me task manger services  todoist more than that  i even consult with anydo technical support team how to transfer my database to todoist and over the phone i also remind them to cancel it i received the cancellation notice and i did not ask them to renewcontinue any of anydo services more than that  i also have the invoice from the company i moved my services todoist for the same period of time that anydo charged me for after i tried to contact anydo they refused to refund me therefore i let you and everybody to know that i will not use any of anydo services anymore and recommend everyone that read this post do not use anydo services or you taking a big risk that something like that will happen to you as well
1,every service i attempted to connect gmail gtasks google calendar timed out during setup oops error been 2 days and still no reply from support device is samsung s9 with android 10
1,this app used to be great when paired with alexa every once in awhile the sync would break but disabling the app and relinking the account would fix the issue this has not been the case for the past several months anydo it is no longer syncing with alexa and based on the reviews of the alexa app it is affecting a lot of people has been ongoing for weeks and there doesnt appear to be a fix coming going to give anylist a try to see if it works with alexa
1,i dont knowwhy people appreciate this appnot user friendly
1,time setting is so dumb fix it
1,sweety sweety kumari
1,not working
1,no integration with created alexa lists
1,you have to pay for all the decent features theres nothing you want to do that your alarm doesnt already do
1,cant open
1,hopeless
1,i dont understand how it works not very clear on how to use it and it comstantly showed notifications for anything i made a note of
1,do not have option to not connect to fb google or email
1,its testing the edge of my patience even though i have better internet connection it keeps saying couldnt find the internet connection try again later its my first time i cant sign in so i cant go in to the app and plan anything already i tried reinstall twice
2,please add upi feature because i tried many debit cards to get the premium versionof this app but any of them was accepted
2,lost all my lists when i was forced to give email address was good prior to having to start all over
2,many errors the app is good but sometimes with the recurrent task do not work when i use desktop app it do not sync well and i lose many task and this is unpleasant pay for this app with this errors is a bad idea i do no feel secure with app i lose taks and time i hope the app get better and the plan my day would be good if add the tasks in someday
2,since last 2 updates i am facing this problem that when i open the app one or two tasks get shuffled to the top then i have to put it again in the planned sequence this happens almost everytime i open the app
2,updates made it worse was using it all the time and the recent updates made it all confusing and unnecessarily graphically complex sorry had to uninstall
2,rare
2,good app but i wish there was a monthly payment option for premium instead of annual
2,pushing to hard for premium upgrade not interested anymore
2,ill join with my fellow reviewers and say that i was very satisfied with the app when i started using it about two years ago but since then i feel that its functionality and simplicity have been compromised especially with the newest update that just made the apps interface via smartphone completely uncomfortable because i cant see my tasks laid out chronologically in an organized and pleasing way anymore
2,whapp integration is bad barely anything works focus to whapp integration and seeya again
2,it was good until they updated it and took out the today someday upcoming categories out which is how i organized everything
2,i found this app difficult to organize in a way that was useful for me i couldnt separate which items showed up on my phone widget by topic so it showed all of them which was unnecessary i also found the reminders to plan my day annoying it would be better with an improved calendar and prioritizing options last it is extremely frustrating to try and unsubscribe from yearly renewal it is buried deep in the info and the actual faq for this has a broken link super sketchy and rude
2,widget not working everytime i checked the next or previous month itd be lagging and later it was just blank love the app but i really need the widget sorry
2,no repeat alarm
2,why are random items popping up on our grocery list is this your way of advertising we have purchased unnecessary items that i had never even heard of sun maid smore bites nope no one added them on i love using the app but this is very deceptive manipulating the grocery lists
2,i switched to anydo when wunderlist ended i wanted a simple interface that let me share lists and tasks with my husband anydo did that but in the least efficient way possible our initials are the same and tiles arent customizable so it was impossible to tell who a task was assigned to the app always defaulted to tasks even if i had just been using a shopping list it was a huge pain to navigate not what we needed at all
2,confused
2,i like this apps but the thing is anything need to pay so sorry to do list i only gave it 2 star and its so bad 
2,star
2,the app used to be great now its intrusive i cant get it to stop popping up and inserting itself into my life uninstall
2,google login not working at all tried 2 accounts gets stuck at setting up
2,with the recent upgrade the phone app arbitrarily deletes things off my to do list or moves them around without me doing it the app on my desktop is now slower than molasses it worked great until the upgrade
2,tarefas tasks somem sozinhas e atrasam nos horários em demais semanas prédefinidas a ideia do aplicativo é boa mas esses problemas o torna praticamente inútil inviável utilização
2,its ok i guess
2,the app was great until i suddenly lost all my data i went to launch it after closing it 30 minutes ago and everything was gone i had so many tasks and notes in it
2,app shouldnt enforce sign in for use uninstalled waste of time edit that sounds like optional functionality for an app labeled to do list not a complete blocker to using the app for a simple i need to make a quick note to remind myself of later this isnt very good
2,not what is expected
2,useful app but it just beepedpopped up a notification advertising some new features i consider that spam thats why youre getting the 2 stars
2,first day of downloading it it drained my battery in 6h both phone and watch battery went back to normal once i uninstalled it please fix that guys so we can use the app
2,perhaps the least user friendly app on playstore my head is spinning why is it so hard to edit the time of reminder
2,the last update removed grid view and left us with a very odd task interface
2,this is not free paid one some features are limited till paid
2,upon making a task setting time and date by typing them has become absurd the app understands what it wants and acts by itself what do you mean use natural language
2,update on 25820  worst update ever was moderately ok until august update app totally dewastated now it is even lags like hell not even able to strike down a task after doing it in one touch 
2,app is good  i am using it since 6 months now but now a days automatically shutdown whole working
2,got into the help menu by accident cant get back to my lists
2,i used this app every day for years but just uninstalled and changed to a different to do list app because of the new layout the grid was much easier to use and better looking
2,i have bought it yet it displays error in verifying my whatsapp integration 
2,a lot of basic features locked away behind a pay wall not very customisable imo  not the right todo list app for me
2,ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if im not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one
2,it duplicates events often with the incorrect time and delete events i invite other to very aggravating
2,constant prompts for trials and upgrades super annoying
2,my rating is just based on my needs the app says it has recurring tasks it does not it does have recurring reminders for on going tasks which may be useful in certain applications the result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone the exact opposite of what a checklist should do if you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app
2,beautifully designed interface but very clickbaity  pushy  i would not recommend
2,bare bones integrations are a lie you have to use a third party app to make it work and zapier is garbage grocery list is kind of cool calendar has that annoying apple style slide that hides evens and is impossible to read instead of traditional blocks support button is for bug fixes only so premium support is also a lie
2,im experiencing issues with the reminder option whenever i set a reminder i get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things this issue wasnt there before what can be done to solve this
2,rimnder alram ka bhi option h ya nhi
2,loved this app but i prefer writing things down
2,ordinary updates delete reminders
2,why pay for such simplicity
2,for an app thats meant to help me organise my time more effectively i didnt expect it would take the longest time to boot up compared to all the utility apps on my device really nice ui though
2,why so expensive microsoft task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has could you please decrease the price a little bit or give me some discount atleast for the first year
2,i like it at lot but it seems like recently this v thing is taking out my battery hogging memory and using data more than chrome which i use constantly until someone can help me figure this out or if this high usage of phone resources is normal i cant rate it any higher i might even have to remove it and search for an alternative
2,cant repeat task at custom intervals
2,it stopped showing reminders and notifications
2,uninstalled i want a simple reminder app that will put a daily notification in my notification bar every single day nothing else no other features but this is so bloated with features its impossible to know if it might do this or not
2,couldnt get the hang of it i want something simple and cheaper to remind me of birthdays and dog to vets etc
2,too annoying premium advertising darkmode is premium only
2,the app was an okay task organizer at best although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly premium subscription even if they asked for support id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like 5 to unlock all features
2,used to be good but now doesnt even notify me and yes this is with the settings amended accordingly
2,some of the sentences on my lists go off the screen so we need an option to wrap the text when it reaches the right side of the screen as of june 4 2017 i can not sign on anymore using samsung galaxy after upgrading to android 70 software as of 6192020 i never did get anydo to work on my samsung galaxy s7 but it now works on my samsung note 8
2,you better dont rotate your phone from vertical to horizontal when typing new task because it will be gone anydo support team said 2 years ago that it will be fixed but its still not also i have over 80 tasks and would love to see the search feature and ability to sort tasks by the date of their creation and by the alert date the search was implemented but i dont know how to use it probably it works only on paid version
2,i liked it because of plan a tree cz i really needed it but its expensive soo k bye
2,the update is annoying i want to add time on the list but you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed
2,laggin cannot open tq
2,recurring reminders are available for free in google reminder you cant monetize the basic functions
2,for me it frequently stops syncing i currently cant get it working again but when it was working it was great
2,doesnt work on windows
2,not user friendly
2,used to love this app after the latest update its garbage cant turn off the automatic datetime thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time will hang onto it for a bit in hopes that a new update will fix this issue or at least give the option to turn it off
2,the website boasts that anydo is the best grocery list app for android wear lies there is no way to view lists on android wear only add tasks you can view lists on apple watch this is the feature i need and i guess ill look elsewhere
2,reminder does not pop up on time or in some cases does not pop up at all
2,i love using this app however when i installed it to one of my phones i cannot login to it it just keeps closing i dont know whats wrong also i wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks
2,not the bloody annoying calendartask widget thing again you did this once before i dont want to use your calendar just the task list so please bring back the option of a widget without the calendar option written at the top will use an alternative until i see anydo has been updated
2,paywall even for dark theme very disappointed
2,not yet solved cannot log in
2,i need this app to share tasks real time with my significant other unfortunately when she is adding tasks from ios sometimes they do no show up for me switching to microsoft to do and no problems additionally being able to paste multiple cells from excel makes ms offering indispensable something i would sorely miss if i returned to anydo
2,it cant adjust tasks with realtime line
2,i actually love this and have use this for a year but the new update is no good at all that i need to edit my review due to the changes
2,in a word clunky i like the calendar integration however everything else is basic and clunky simply adding a task to a list takes 3 clicks and you cannot set a date time subtasks or notes unless you exit out of the task and going back to your list the app is designed to give you as many notifications as it can and constantly advertise the premium version and whatever you do do not sign up for a free trial unless youre willing to spend an hour searching for how to do so
2,whuup sorry need to pay for unlimited daily task nope
2,buggy interface the grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible it kept changing event details after i saved i had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events that i had alarms off and it would not let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day no matter how many times i changed the dates it kept including the day before in my all day event and then when i would try to edit it it would change completely to two days before what a mess
2,free version is very limited compared to ticktick and microsoft to do
2,ive enjoyed using this app since i got it two weeks ago until recently when it began crashing when id add tasks
2,the grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone this has caused issues for us where ive missed items when shopping this is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that i have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place ive tested and when i add the item snacks on my wifes phone they dont appear on my grocery list i can not recommend this app currently because of this
2,i mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend  for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7  this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff
2,a mess of features that dont serve me cumbersome ux
2,when i saw that dark theme was premium only i stopped and uninstalled immediately frankly i was insulted are you hoping to squint me into submission if i cant try your app comfortably then why bother there are identical apps im exploring now that youre competing with so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions i would pay to lift its like youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use ac
2,i have cancelled my subscription an amount of rs 90990 has been deducted from my account kindly refund the same im not interested in the app
2,this app always put the things i havent done to the next day i dont like this it should be stay at there if i didnt finished the work nor help me move to the next day and ask me to do it if i didnt finished it ill continue the work tomorrow i dont need you to help me move the task to the next day its annoying
2,lost another star for your reply to my previous comment i like the moment notification i like planning my day i hate the dumb sounds i cant turn off for every item i snooze
2,im sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned but having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me because i would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but i cant get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark
2,not free
2,you can t manage it easily per day the interface is not clear when i click on a day i want to say only that day agenda not others around it when i add a task it doesn t show me in which day is added  i have at least ten ideas to improve they contact me i will uninstall it for now i submitted few complaints but there are more
2,important features locked behind a pay wall
2,a suspicious app do not recommend this application
2,poor widget options which is what i needed most very space inefficient and not customizable at all disappointing todoist had the most compact and useful widget followed by microsoft todo
2,keep losing mini steps after i write them down
2,thought it be a great replacement for gtasks main issue with tasks is lack of pc app i like the anydo widget as it has a transparent option i use recurring tasks a lot a routine which can be ticked and on the next day theyll reappear which i found seemeles in the google app unfortunately in anydo you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time they dont stack on each other creating a long list of notifications in the morning also no visual event line in calendar month view
2,estou tendo dificuldades com alguns bugs
2,there is a issue with notes for as long as i can remeber you sometimes add a note and its gone later i keep having to go out and come back each time i add one in hope its saved
2,i like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing  its imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee they justify it by saying its a service blabla its an to do app more people would actually pay for it if it wouldnt be a subscription model
2,doesnt show empty hours like gcalender also asking me to subscribe from the get go
2,we dont use it like at all its not that different from your regular phone calendar id actually like a refund didnt even realize i was charged
2,nice polished but useless there is no filter for tags web and app synch problems happens missing tasks not any scoring system may good for amateurs but not for project managers however i like the calendar view
2,there are certain things i love like the fact that it sorts my grocery list by aisle automatically but overall this app stresses me out i just want an app that allows me to share my grocery list but the grocery list seems buried in an area that isnt intuitive i dont need something to schedule every second of my life which seems to be more this apps aim
2,you reaaallllyyy dont have a lot without paying
2,cant add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee
2,the design is nice but it doesnt understand when i said later when i said remind me tomorrow morning it replied okay ill be reminded tomorrow at 1600 thats afternoon ill be very well roasted by my boss by then cant find any help on these issues was close to confirming my subscription sad 
2,premium version only
2,is there no way to assign a specific color to an event i like to group my meetings by color if i cant do that the app isnt useful for me
2,trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what i set it as trying to change the date back just creates a second event then trying to delete both events takes several tries because half the time they dont actually delete this is really annoying
2,weak and underdeveloped platform dont expect support to treat you like a person  this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you
2,recurring tasks are very glitchy  they sometimes change the day or time when they recur per anydos request i sent them a video of this happening crickets no explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested fine otherwise but i rely on recurring items
2,missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items
2,it doesnt sync up with google tasks not worth the change zapier does not work for android zapier only works if you pay the premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with google tasks it does not import current tasks previously created in google tasks there is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from google to anydo and i cant afford 7200 right off the bat to do it
2,new great concept but not for confidential data because its not encrypted nor pw protected on phone or pc and one day anydo company will get hacked  all your stuff be be out there like equifax resolved app loses your work eg i created a new task started a notes section pasted it in some material and clicked save then i went to another app to get more material but when i returned to anydo my notes were gone your save button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked
2,nested can be improved
2,its a fine app but logs me out every other time i go to use it
2,hi developer need to improve note module it fix only for protrait view which is when im using landscape view tablet with keyboard i need to adjust my head or the gadget tq
2,recurring tasks are behind a pay wall ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature app is a little ugly and not customisable
2,themes and location based reminders are under subscription both are free on most of apps like this thanks but no ill pass and keep using google keep
2,not so great the user interface is not friendly making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way that i found to make a list that repeats daily ill just stick to google keep
2,strange thing when i mark recurrent tasks as done in web desktop version into the upcoming section
2,notification is now pathetic shame i liked it a lot i think its time to jump ship its been fun
2,after all this time you still can not search tasks on android so you have to look through every task you have created and through each list to find what task you are looking for going down to 2 star
2,muito limitador pra quem não paga pra usa e nem é tão vom assim
2,it used to be a slick minimal app that did what it needed to then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it no thanks
2,слишком сложно но при этом нет того что нужно очень много возможностей но не смог элементарно сделать todo список на _каждый_ день и постоянно лезут с предложением купить премиум да не вопрос если бы был необходимый функционал ощущение что приложение разработано рубить бабло но при этом не задумываясь о потребностях пользователя
2,no monthly recurring reminder features cant even remind me when to pay the bills
2,have to create an account just to check out functionality dont want to do that uninstalling
2,how do i unsubscribe this useless app
2,list feature sucks i dont need to manage myself so i cant speak to that functionality i just wanted a list app preferably one that worked with google assistant although that feature works great the list feature kind of sucks in an attempt to look new and edgy the user experience went down the drain i found it clunky  irritating i shouldnt have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items i need again and thats just one of many irritations anylist baby
2,update used to be great now theyve added so many steps its no longer the simple app it used to be very disappointed
2,i can t select weekly days which days i need remainder and this drawback of app best to go with other app
2,uninstalled after latest update and it blocked all my lists until i set up an account no thanks
2,the not completed tasks do not carry over to the next day automatically i wanted an app that would constantly flash incomplete tasks in my home screen otherwise presentation of the app is good
2,very average app not intuitive  will probably spend more time trying to plan than doing
2,i dont liek it rlly
2,premium version is too much expensive anydo should provide an option in which we can select max 3 to 5 apps for integration in premium version  pay accordingly
2,looks really good but im not going to pay a subscription for it sorry if you said one off payment then maybe most of the locked features are available in other products out there
2,well designed and all however alot of the crutial features are locked behind the premium which u need to pay for
2,unable to edit time for reminder s7
2,cant really set custom remindere for example i need to be able to check a specific system every 3 hours with other variables cant do it
2,could have been a good free app nice design  good ideas but the free version keeps forgetting the task alarm i configured i put it at 6 but it resets it at 9 dont know about the paid one
2,hi there i would like to know if this application is for free or do i need to pay for it thank you for your answer
2,day 2 of trialling this so far ive had two location reminders fail i cant label a location with more than one letter the only time based reminder thats fired did so while on a phone call so i dont know what it sounds like not that i can change the sound anyway because the instructions dont work i had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours how is that a typical snooze length adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive
2,i want to discontinue and it was monthly base they charge me yearly its very sad pls help and refund
2,it sorely needs and undo  backuprestorerevert feature in case we accidentally touchswipe a circlebullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately which i find incredibly frustrating it also needs a flexible feature to import  export other common textdata formats like csv xml events to  from calendar not just copy reminders to tasks if google fixes all that then id give it 5stars
2,i love this app but recently the app keeps crashing everytime i enter plus the calendar is completely wrong 
2,no dark theme without a premium subscription ok
2,its very simple and its interface is so beautiful why did i put 2 stars then because most of it features are limited to the paid edition even the important ones
2,looks like a copy of an iphone app im not impressed by the huge bar in the bottom or the single colored ui a night mode should come standard
2,there is no sound
2,too much spam stuff that i dont care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders i wanted the app for also too many emails i dont want more clutter to organize my life
2,very productive
2,i dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service
2,not a great user interface have been using for almost 2 months but still struggling
2,hate subscription uninstalled
2,does this app work without internet connection also
2,gaada waktu kapan harus selesai jadi kurang detail
2,over all good task manager but i do not like misleading and untrue boasts about integration with ms outlook it is possible but only via zappier plus functionality is limited not possible to sync task between this 2apps
2,sharing didnt work theres a permanent notification and everything is premium option even the theme
2,i was willing to give this a try to see if it suits my needs seemed ok with limited use so far the only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and anydo takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day i dont need it taking over things i will plan when i want are you seriously doing this it is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying
2,syncing with alexa takes over 1015 minutes which renders it unusable anydo before you post your generic response yes i added the skill to my alexa and yes i logged into my accounts it syncs kind of so i can verify the two accounts are talking just not well at all when i use wunderlist or google tasks or just alexa by itself the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms the only reason i downloaded with app was to give me more control over my alexa lists which for some insane reason you cannot reorder the extremely lag in syncing anydo with alexa renders this app useless the ui looks really nice and user friendly so i bumped it up to 2 stars
2,i dont care for it when i first opened it it showed me all these appointments i was thinking what the heck then i figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current to me thats just a bunch of clutter then it was telling me i had five appointments this month no only have one it only showed the one but it still says 5 i dont have a clue what the other four are anytime i try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium i just uninstalled it
2,good until it started wanting money for doing its job
2,pretty with nice add ons and integrations but more than once ive gone back to a long list i created to find it gone or reverted back to a very old version so annoying dont need the song and dance this app offers if it cant save a basic list
2,i was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app its integration with google calendar being exactly what im looking for but now i see that it has no search feature on android worse still android search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and its still not done 2015 in the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags status and free text seriously behind the curve guys
2,wear os app only supports adding tasks not viewing existing ones without reminders
2,i tried it years ago and never really got it going then i switched to wunderlist and became an organized machine now wunderlist is being retired so i thought id try again guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved nope no ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so i dont have to flip through all my lists to find the one i want not even a list view to make them easier to find
2,downloads the app but package file is invalid error pops up before completing installation
2,its very confusing i got the calendar app that was suggested to me when i wanted to use the widget but once i started using the calendar along with anydo the tasks notifications got duplicated i dont see the point of having anydo when the calendar app does the same thing
2,so far so good bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it translation to greek is not fluent for the price tag  annually i would apprechiate developers look closer at them will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year on a positive note love the widget using however nova launcher current rating will change based on the experience
2,ah yes wanna use an advanced calendar well turns out you must have an account for that whats that your eyes are burning under this bright theme well we have a solution just for you as you have seen in our tips you can change the theme oh w o p s no you cant how silly of us to not tell you in tips that buy our premium maybe its just not what i was looking for
2,too whacked for creating lists like grocery or to do with their tasks and subtasks instead of just lists you can check complete
2,im a student and was looking for something get myself very organized i have tried series of productivity apps before apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for integration with other apps which i love two things i found disappointing features are extremely limited without premium its almost impossible to use like that also very expensive i couldnt find statistics from totally hours and other reports
2,there should be a dark mode instead of setting through a premium theme option
2,i liked using this app but i recently noticed that important information i had saved in sub tasks has all been deleted its happened before and i thought i had made a mistake but no its just this app malfunctioning
2,many times ive put sub tasks on my todo tasks and they just disappear for some reason ive forgotten many things because of this and still hasnt been fixed despite various updates
2,app not bad but very limited unless you pay downloaded this app after reading in the news about its whatsapp integration that is only available if you pay without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app
2,i am a paid user of this app i like this app a lot until android 10 they claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app i use daylio has a nice notification that jumps out at you like anydo used to now anydo gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic then it gives its notification to plan your day so its two clicks with a big visual pause in between not cool 
2,i dont like that it requires you to login why cant i just use it without logging in my accounts
2,questionable experience upgraded to premium but whatsapp integration is not working seems a little confusing
2,zero features in free version
2,good shared tasks but app itself makes me angry it keeps forgetting i am logged in with my google account so i need to login for like each two weeks or so and it also forgets my settings edit unfortunately this has not been fixed yet even though i had sent logs and communicated with you decreasing my rating
2,i can not figure out how to get it on my galaxy watchugh
2,when you switch the language you get wierd bug that your app is half in english half in selected language
2,i was given this premium app now with new versions is not updating i fail to understand this if im given premium version then now why wouldnt it get updated if it was non upgradable then why was it given its a great app and so it hurts when there are such tricks used on customers
2,dec 5 2019 update moved from 5 stars to 2 for the reason below ive had this app for about half a decade the last couple years have been irritating i add sub tasks when i go back to the tasks the sub tasks arent there i wish there was a save button as a cue and confirmion that the subtasks are saved not sure how long i could forgive the app until i just use another one altogether please address subtasks staying in the next update thanks was 5 stars for the longest time awesome
2,useful as a todo list sets a real annoying plan your day popup reminder every morning how you disable it is non obvious uninstalled
2,cant clean up old alexa lists we use this purely for the alexa shopping list integration however early on it was very buggy so we had to relink our alexa account a number of times and now we have like 4 or 5 old alexa shopping lists that we cannot delete alexa lists can not be modified with anydo you can do it from the alexa app no i can not because it only deletes the working one
2,reminder feature is not working 
2,allowed all the permissions for this app but i still cant get the reminder to work on my smartphone running android 8 downloaded a different reminder app and also allowed all permissions for it and it worked well
2,i had made an account for this app a long time ago but didnt use it for long and i forgot why until i redownloaded it today this is one of those apps thats incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall andor you have to make an additional account for paying more than 1mo for a list app is ridiculous if anything it should be a onetime purchase
2,i used to love it it was my go to app for many years but over the time it is losing the special status it doesnt have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times they removed that
2,the alarm feature does not work which leads to missing the tasks
2,nice looking ui but inability to disable popups is a deal breaker for me uninstalled
3,this still works pretty well but im not a fan of the updated widget not listing tasks chronologically
3,good app annoying pop up every morning on my phone even though i have the notification turned off
3,i havent used they made an effort from there side im a bit of a mess and i need time
3,299 nothing new ive already reconciled to that improved gui  16720 3819 no a long time ago i was able to create a full with a reminder task in a landscape mode its impossible now after that redesign  177 23 im pretty sure i was able to createedit a new task in one go and in landscape it takes more moves now  222019 i cannot believe that when i have got to change a grip from portait to landscape when creating  editing a task it is more effective than before
3,ive been a satisfied user of anydo since march 2018 and my subscription is until 2021 however when i tried to create a recurring event it kept directing me to the subscription page much to my disappointment
3,some features just dont work in the free app i have tried to set a daily reminder for 9am to put a ticket in my car once i click done it sets the reminder the next day at 1am i dismissed the 1am reminder once half asleep as the sound woke me up it never reminded me again and now i have a parking fine to pay i have real memory difficulties and need an app that actually works properly disappointing as i find the one off reminders really helpful
3,i am not sure who want to pay monthly fee for a todo list app one time payment always make a sense
3,started out strong first few days perfect synced to smart watch and woke with everything planned but now its not sending the notifications regularly  not to watch or android phone added it to the pc and tried the phone widget  maybe that broke it weird pile of repeated completed daily tasks with no time set while the daily tasks with times dont notify some work then dont  very frustrating clearing the cachereinstall didnt work feels like a battle to get it to function 
3,features are all right it doesnt seem to me like they actually use their own product else the idiosyncrasies would have been ironed out
3,didnt like
3,now able to see list view from widget thanks to developer response  but theres a new bigger problem now the integration with google assistant is going terribly everytime i try to add an item to my grocery list through google assistant anydo creates a new list called grocery when i ask whats on my grocery list it replies you have 3 lists named grocery which would you like
3,it was awesome at first then i try to add an event from the widget and it wont do it correctly super frustrated
3,nuisance app it probably works fine but its definitely not for me however when i decided to uninstall it it gave me no easy way to delete my account to delete my account i need to enter a password i never set a password because i signed up with google so i have to login to create a password just to enter password to delete the account i havent figured out how to revoke the permissions i gave this is abusive deleting an account and data should be straightforward
3,love this app but some functions make the productivity lacking in my experience there is a limited amount of notifications i can receive from this app per day there appears to be no way to change this on the settings for my phone or the app this is problematic for me because i have the premium version and have it connected to zapier i am not receiving push notifications when actions are taking place very disappointing as this is crucial for time management projects with teams
3,the next 7 days is no longer showing the next 7 days but rather group by lists and not by days
3,i have used this app for years it is great if you want to be more organized and get reminders of the tasks you need to do i must say however that the app itself has regressed throughout the years with all the updates things used to be simple and intuitive now i dont understand what half the buttons do basic functions like deleting and removing tasks are way too clunky the concept of the app is great but i cant recommend it anymore each update makes it worse
3,its a good app it reminds me of things i tend to forget dont get me wrong its good just that i dont like the layout that came wirh the recent update everything is cluttered now before things were organized what happened
3,99 premium advertising free version is not usable
3,i pay for the premium app and it keeps closing down on me once im in the app what can i do to keep that from happening
3,just enough features to be useful yet simple and mostly uncluttered been using the app for years the new rocket animation showing total tasks completed and congratulating me for the most mundane thing is extremely irritating though and lost the app a star
3,almost perfect app just one thing i wish anydo had is hourly reminders and copy reminders to set the same task just a different time this is coming from a paid subscriber
3,what happened to the missed calls notification i recently switched phones and had to download the new version and the option is no longer there it was one of the main reasons i used the app
3,to be fair i downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes the reason for this is that i hate apps that scream pay me money since the instance you download it and this one did that exactly with the free premium trial being in your face all the time and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is premium just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it it looks amazing though
3,love it great future
3,so nice
3,fantastic
3,too many options and gets too fancy for an app that should just have simple functionality to setup reminders and to do items
3,good app but needs ability to customize recurring events by allowing us to input an end date ie cant end a private lesson series after 8 lessons it reoccurs forever
3,la baje para sincronizarla con whatsapp y esa función es paga por lo demás no la probé
3,way too expensive if there was a monthly option i may consider going premium
3,expirencing some problems with the reminder sometimes it sounds sometimes it doesnt help please
3,great ui an reminder app only downside is i cant mute notifications for certain accounts which is really annoying id like to see my events but not have notifications for them as i have a ton
3,just not for me they also seem to refuse to let you delete your account by refusing a password that was created 15 seconds lots of cool features but not what im looking for
3,perderam integração com a alexa ao selecionar a opção no anydo sou direcionado para o app amazon alexa e lá aparece a mensagem de erro que essa skill não existe mais
3,reporting abuse
3,i like it true
3,app is fantastic however when a task reminder pops up it disappears without acknowledging the notification it used to have an icon at the top left but it does not show up anymore not sure if it is a big in the latest update please fix i am on a oneplus 7 pro running the latest os
3,hyyy
3,any do moments are not working for me  please look into it
3,1 when i access from pc it shows different calander google account and when i access from phone it shows different google account i use 4 different gmail accounts 2 also when a task is completed or deleted from the app without touching the notification bar on phone notification on phone stays it has to be swiped away manually so i have to use two actions to delete one tasks edit1 now the app sticks and has become slow after the recent update i tried uninstalling and reinstalling still no success it
3,dont know
3,i cant set my time the same time i write up a task i always have to save then revisit and set the time which is very annoying also i cant upgrade to the premium version which is very disappointing overall not a bad app but there are a few things that need to be tweaked
3,it went from simple and useful to cool and confusing this morning i dont know what is going on im disturbed
3,great features ability to collaborate and plenty of options i just wish the interface was designed by a human being its the most cluttered and hard to navigate todo list app by far compare it to google tasks for example you just open the app and start typing and everything you need is right there with easily discoverable features this app constantly had me frustrated and searching around for what i wanted to do ui in general looks like a high schooler with a ui hobby made it basic af
3,we need a monthly payment terms currently it is yearly only
3,i absolutely loved this app but for the last week or so i cannot scroll through the calendar function without it scrolling itself back up to the previous week horrendously annoying if you could fix this that would be awesome as otherwise i would have given 5 stars
3,mobile app isnt very intuitive but the desktop app is good
3,i like the app overall but there are bugs that need fixed the app keeps stopping also pay and buy need a recurring option
3,all around amazing life improver with one irritating caveat the reordering functionality could really use some work often the reordering fails and the task gets thrown out of today into someday which means i have to go fish it out from a long list sometimes this will happen multiple times in a row really testing my patience been dealing with it for many months now  want to continue using this awesome app but really struggling with this one bug galaxy s9 android 10 one ui 21
3,beautiful interface but it is very annoying to navigate and not fluid creating reoccurring tasks seems to be a pain not sure if its me or the app but i kept having to change the time 23 times to get the correct times reoccurence grocery list is awesome the calendar looks like google calendar which is nice but it is choppy to navigate
3,the day ended and i didnt end my task and it didnt shift or alarm about undone tasks
3,its not what i need
3,it had a peculiar issue i have set it up to remind me of my ask with on screen notification but often it fails to do so and then i miss the task
3,this is so frustrating i set a event for someones birthday then a event a month ago before the birthday to not forget to buy the stuff they want and nothing shows up nvm it shows up on my google calendar
3,dont have a monthly plan i cant find it in the premium section
3,i like the functions wish the support was better
3,well i have suggestion make a system where students could track time like total available time then distribute it over task
3,not pleased
3,i love the widget but whenever i edit an event on the calendar it changes the day to like the day before without me doing so and its extremely annoying
3,how to get the pop up for missing call alerts
3,the latest app update 72620 new app navigation is a definite downgrade from panes to a one side scroll now i can no longer see full task list names the all tasks option is changed the new layout sucks why do developers always do this fix things that arent broken why cant you just improve the things people are requesting instead of changing everything else around too this ver is much harderinconvenient to navigate than the previous one was trying to revert to older
3,dont like the app and trying to unsubscribe but there is no option
3,cant importsync w google tasks
3,the daily reminder does not work i mean it works on the first day but than on the next day it does not make sounds or pop up when its to do the task
3,while it sure has its benefits theres still a lot to be desired
3,problem with the notification cant complete task from notification keep showing till i mark task as finished that too by opening the app
3,sir i have deleted this app i cant understand how to do so that the reason please reset my google account from any do and donot charge after 7 day trial
3,extremely aggressive in pushing the premium and paid version also overly complex since as its name denotes it tries to do everything or anything it may be beneficial to consolidate and duplicate tasks of several other apps even though some can perform better compare the shopping list in google keep which is easier to add or subtract items from a constant shopping list this app combining tasks from other apps can be useful depending on an individuals preferences and abilities
3,literally half the features under premium can be found free with other apps
3,its ok
3,how to connect with yahoo mail
3,needs smart dictation like todoist and better calendar widgets like ticktick
3,needs work time options in custom are not professional enough
3,cant move it to sd card i need space on my phone so ill likely be deleting it
3,review more for 5 stars
3,i paid for premium account but my account status is still free with no premium feature
3,i really want to like this app we use it to share shopping lists but the syncing with my wifes phone leaves much to be desired
3,i am on premium and i dont receive whatsapp messages as reminders
3,add features like todoist
3,i like the app but the only thing which i personally wanted was if i were able to share picture with my shared tasks people lets say i make a task to pay bill with my husband but i want to send him the image of the bill other than that better from other apps
3,i have used this for a while and though it isnt a perfect fit it does a great job of allowing me to schedule alarms for tasks and easy snoozing of those alarms but they updated and fixed what wasnt broken now all uncompleted tasks show in the task window with no delineation of whether they are recent scheduled or past due visually it is very confusing im probably going to dump this app i would like a good calendar view of things scheduled on each day and it doesnt have that
3,ok
3,you have to pay to get half the features
3,very limited without premium
3,when you put something in a category and then rename it you have to recategorise not amazing at sharing  list items get out of sync on multiple devices
3,its got promise just not there yet to many glitches to justify the premium version small things here an there but the main problem is events consistently erase information and become in unable to edit now you have permanent events stuck in your calendar that cannot be changed for the free version i guess you could put up with it but its still annoying its got style and potential one day i hope to be back and check it out again
3,best gui with few bugs
3,i left a review earlier that was one star while the app wasnt for me i found that it was confusing and didnt suit my needs so i deleted it shortly after the customer service was fantastic i was charged for a subscription even though i didnt use the app because i made a mistake in canceling the subscription i sent an email detailing my problem and asking for a refund the response was quick and a refund was granted i thought it was only fair to come back and leave a nicer review
3,i just downloaded the app not quite long ive started to enjoy it but theres one problem the widget is usually empty even though there are tasks in the app what can i do about it
3,برنامه عالیه اما اکثر امکاناتش پولیه
3,nice
3,very handy if youre going shopping or need reminders on what you want to purchase easy to use and plenty of features
3,i have such extensive ideas for productivity apps that a developer should retain me as a consultant before the competition gets me none are even close to my standards yet one general idea for free if a customization option that any one todo list app has is useful why dont they all have it
3,app was excellent till recent but im unable to add new task after recent updates
3,i really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me
3,this is a simple free app with an easy to use features and interface but not much to explore limited with only the premium features as something that might pique your interest on other than those this app does what it says on the description if youre interested in a straighttothepoint checklist with minimal features i think this can be your go to app 3 stars since this is not what i personally would look for in a to do app
3,missing an important feature they need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day it is a must for someone who has adhd i would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature
3,bug is there in recent version whenever i try to mark incomplete a task a duplicate task comes up with same name again and again also we cannot recover our mistakenly deleted task
3,its okay so far but im not sure on how to find the focusing tree part in order for me to stay focused just wondering how you do it other than that not too bad of an app
3,it is not working
3,like
3,waiting for the bug to be fixed which causes the tasks to be moved out of order and disappearotherwise great app
3,i want to use this app but i cant do log in many times i uninstall and reinstall but prb is still not solved
3,still exploring sry
3,i believe i am rating about getting back on engine browser and phone after batteries or devices cannot interface
3,tried it the app worked well but found something that works better for me personally
3,not so good
3,this site is most suitable for those who wanted to get a jobs from home thanks a lot
3,great app but i am not getting notifications even when i set time to remind
3,going for free and better microsoft todo
3,so far im not impressed and i dont see where its worth over 40 a year to use im really trying to use it for everything since i did pay for it but to me its just not worth it
3,not bad
3,need more with app so far sogood
3,overall not a bad app for the first week or so it gave me notifications when it was supposed to but after that its almost like it forgot sometimes itself eg notification on saturday when i set it for friday reminders for things i have set daily dont even come up anymore but it remembers to give me an displayoverapp notification to remind me to set a reminder also no push notifications that take you into the app so youd have to do it yourself subtasks are my favourite feature
3,will not let me start the free trial or for that matter purchase an upgrade so for now since its stuck like me 3 get it fixed and ill improve score
3,hey dev please bring back old ui in quick add widget this new update does not have faster and efficient adding task event old version was perfect please i have been using anydo since 4 years please dont spoil it
3,i would honestly give this app a chance if more features were available for free users a lot of people dont have the money to spend on an app like this and since there are many other options i will try those instead premium for this app looks really helpful and the layout of this app is great but im going to have to uninstall since the free version isnt really helpful to me 
3,i had opted for premium but even basic things like i wanted to start fresh so i said delete all tasks but it added that as a reminder from whats app
3,nice app i think but you need premium to use it free version is very ripped off
3,delet
3,thank you 
3,features available in many apps for free are paid here
3,i would normally give this 5 stars but the past few days the widget has not allowed me to make tasks on future dates it just puts the task on todays date and you cant put tasks on random future days either tomorrow yes but i like to plan ahead of tomorrow
3,dont understand collaborative editing
3,custom sound taken away now you say theyre back thry arent showing up hit and miss with quick add task doing voice input is annoying too make that a setting but the biggest is the custom sound issue now adding a timed reminder is harder just a tiny little bell icon to try and hit its crammed next to other icons so its easy to tap the wrong one make better improvements like a continuous scrolling calendar instead of it jumping between months for a reminder the next day
3,not very userfriendly i found it hard to navigate and find what i wanted it works nicely and i appreciate the simple art style
3,on the widget calendar tab not functioning although inside the app already linked my google calendar
3,how do u change it to am or pm because i cant press it and the time is really important
3,cant edit the time of a scheduled task and no soundalarm notifications for the tasks edit sound issue resolved but still having issues with editing tasks not a very user friendly interface
3,imedwin m gonzalesadmin
3,gud
3,it used to be my everyday companion in every organisational way but after the new update there was no way to place a new task into the right day it automatically put the task in the current day not its intentional deadline
3,great app and does what i want it to do is my prefered habit tracker  however i believe the colours should not be a premium feature far too expensive as it is the only reason i would get premium perhaps make adding wallpapers from gallery a premium feature
3,almost a 5 just integrate google reminders so i can ask google to remind me about things and keep track of them here update 42720 google integration is here it doesnt work now you get 3 stars for doing a crappy job 
3,reminder sound not sounding
3,it is better than the normal app in your phone i only wish their was better support for the calendar
3,need more user friendly interface but very useful application my mobile
3,updated review left review here for wrong app not bad so far migration of data off wunderlist mixed up all the items in the list sorted by date not within each list not necessarily the apps fault just challenging just to get started already deleted two other apps that were worse
3,everything is great but the sort by time isnt working properly
3,ive been using this for a long while now and it remains the penultimate perfect todo list app i recommend it to pretty much everyone i talk to especially friends family and coworkers  4182020 latest update has eliminated the ability to resize widgets as needed the remaining options are too large or too small
3,i asked seven days trial to see whether i like or not and you have already taken the money for the whole entire year that is a ripoff
3,tried to share a list with my husband but it wont share between my office account and his personal account its a show stopper
3,nice up the only problem is price prices are the same to first world and third world they dont have option to poor countries only for the rich ones they dont have even option to students the product is good but theres no equality sad
3,dont personally care for the user interface or reminderplan your day approach was looking for somethinghonestlysimpler this is over the top for just my husband and i on the other hand for a busy family or business person this is exactly what they need
3,so far i am satisfied with this nice app compare to other simlar apps but one thing i noticed once i restart my gadget it automatically clears all the tasks being displayed on my notifications bar 2020 notifications bar reminders are not synced with the current date why 
3,when i need it which is rare z comes in handy 
3,linked it to my ms exchange sadly it doesnt show the attachments in my calendar entriesshame as this was looking promising
3,very good app simple but enough to use im going to get pro but a question sync with google calendar is 1 way sync only can review or 2 way sync
4,the app is great but it would be better if you could increase the payment methods to upgrade to premium my debit card isnt supported it saysi live in pakistan
4,i wish i could pick the day tasks to display on the widget since the last update i can only see whole lists not those i prioritized edit thanks for the response but this is not true when i change the layout in the app and delete and reload the widget it still lists personal first
4,all good should work on calendar
4,love it but cant afford premium
4,coordinates humans  this app was my goto until covid hit keeping my personal consulting business and day work calendars in one app was madness i broke off my day work to microsoft to do on a separate device anydo now coordinates my consulting and my personal and family tasks lists and bills its refreshing i do have syncing issues for calendar events as well as a crash everytime i add people to invites when creating an event thats why i gave it 4stars love it for tasks
4,good app but didnt exceed my expectations to create a google hangouts scheduler i really want an automatoc hangouts chat scheduled to be sent but when i tried to set it up on zapier it doesnt work i had to unsubscribe to yearly premium im not sure what gives the premium vs free
4,i have been using this app for years and previous update of next 7 days update is amazing i usally plan my day in morning and use widget to view my todays tasks but now app widget shows tasks by category not by next 7 days which has created a serious issue for me i highly recommend in widget show tasks by day wise list not by category wise otherwise for me and for many this app is useless
4,its ok but its not for me im a student and cannot pay for an upgrade in the app the free options are a bit limited so i had to delete this app hope you enjoy it tho edit thank you for replying i will make sure to give it another try and rerate it depending on my second experience  2nd edit its very helpful it does what its created for planning and keeping your life organized and with reminders for us forgetful people  bravo i still feel like its missing something
4,great app but dont want to pay a monthly fee for all the features i dont use please offer a one time fee to use a dark theme  mode so your customers dont have to stare at a glaring white screen white screens also use more battery power than dark ones so it also drains your battery quicker just about everyone else is offering this option for free so please offer it to your customers for a reasonable price too thank you
4,1 it has a calendar feature but you cant customize the calendar events repetition as much as you can in google can do daily but not 5 days a week all in one entry 2 edit figured the task sorting part out sort by time and collapse upcomingtomorrow and it will just show your daily tasks i like that but its still not worth paying for unless the calendar event customization is as good as googles since that is free
4,please if possible can you make it no limit or larger limit as to how many words you can put in a list as it runs out rather quickly l for example if you use it to make a shopping list thank you
4,tried adding some zapier combinations but whenever i need to log into something through apps zapier it fails only works if done outside the app and outside anydo also it would be a great improvement if the calendar widget would show reminderstasks as dot too
4,very  nice
4,great app but buggy keeps asking me to delete all completed tasks even though its empty
4,initial upgrade hid the separation of today tomorrow upcoming and someday after sorting and adding new tasks all of sudden they all showed up again dont know why this happened if these features go away it will make this app much harder to use the bug freaked me out and cause me to write a very bad review which i have since edited and amended
4,best app for ur task management edit for 5 stars u can add more theme options for free version
4,too simplistic but its pretty good
4,why notifications are too short i want to be able custmize my noti sounds
4,ive used this app for many years with good experience lately the ux and complexity have caused some problems nonetheless new features have been very good however with the latest update i can no longer see tasks planned for tomorrow a feature that was the reason for using this app to begin with its just gone with no possibility to configure it again i do understand development of new features but i do not appreciate removal of features that are being used great app not for me anymore
4,還算不錯用簡單易操作
4,its good app but the calendar view doesnt highlight the day youre on its gray like the other days and makes it hard to quicly scroll to todays events for task view it needs to show the time the task is assigned so you can get it done however if you go to calendar view it will show the task and time
4,this is my best to do apps so far and i like it very much i wish there are some tutorial to give some advice on how to use all the apps potential and maybe some connection with google assistant and over voice command
4,i love this application so much good job to the developers however ive been having some issues lately with the application the application refuses to notify me of some tasks i planned to do when trying to set the time for a reminder the clocks 5 minutes faster and automatically blocks the other minutes before as an alternative i set the date and time using natural language but sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt kindly fix this once again its a wonderful application
4,dark theme should be free 
4,have the free version and even that is quite useful in terms of ease of use and integration with calendars now thinking of upgrading could get a 5 then
4,good app
4,like this a lot
4,a very good app easy to write my task and thus no need to remember it the reminder system is good
4,locking option is not availableall other features are excellent
4,i love any but got a few things i dont like for some reason events cannot be colored when they are written directly to anydo as it happens on google calendar and zapier doesnt give you that option i have to write the event in google calendar put the color i want to see it in anydo it would be great if you could enable that option other idea please put a report option of things done in the day and task completed thanks
4,hh
4,this rating is for the free version most feature rich free version ive tried of other to do list type apps interface takes some getting used to but great features and everything seems to be working
4,it would be better if theres an icon beside the task so i can easily identify whether a task has some note to it
4,the app keeps getting back to system language even after i selected a different one countless times ive to select the system language and then select again the language i want the app to be with only for it to go back after a while
4,so great i have suggested this app to many a friend suggestion have the ability to custom the repeat feature in the events sometimes things repeat every week but only for 5 weeks
4,muy buena app funciona bien y es muy simple e intuitiva el único pero que le puedo poner es que cuando mando a mis compañeros de trabajo algún quehacer no siempre llega la notificación
4,its good app for all
4,i love it so far
4,great
4,i am using it daily
4,suggestions  make the tag colors the background of the task and not just a small line under the task title at least have this as an option  the trees in the focus mode are all the same no matter how quick or long you do a task add variety to this mode treesplants to choose from other decorations probably even animals or different landscapes add more music to choose from too i definitely love the look and feel of this app i enjoy it better with premium though
4,good design features
4,i really enjoy using the app but i want to suggest a daily summary of tasks to be done in the morning and tasks completed and those that were not thanks for your hard work
4,i dont like that ths deleted or finished every day just let the incomplete ones roll over and the completed ones stay back
4,theres a bug where i set a reminder on saturday weekly then after i saved it it shows friday on the screen
4,it is very nice app it would be good if you could add due date option for tasks
4,a good app to remind me of things i need to do
4,gr8
4,excited
4,very useful
4,make dark theme available in the free app
4,can i import my task list from google keep app
4,it would be better if there was a voice command like alexa
4,thanks for the support battery optimiser on xiaomi disables the autostart of the app it works now
4,has been super helpful in organising my days has made getting my chores sorted so easy
4,so far so good
4,nice app able to manage my tasks
4,i like this app it helps me to accomplish my tasks very comfortably a must have apps for productivity thank you
4,decent app
4,it helps me to remember what to do as i forget sometimes its a nice application but there would be a slight change in it there must be a ringtone to remember not any message as people see calls not messages as my opinion
4,this app is brilliantly developed with all necessary features but few things disappoints us we cannot set sound notification it popups only if we are using mobile sometimes it doesnt remind us the scheduled activity even in notification if these bugs are fixed ill definitely go for paid version with five rating
4,getting better with each up date
4,app parfaite si vous voulez vous tenir à jour et savoir où vous en êtes avec vos tâchesmissions versions gratuite avec quelques publicités mais rien de vraiment méchant a tester absolument 
4,love it
4,anydo moment new colored style isnt good
4,this app was great a year or two ago they spam you now with premium service purchase requests which are costly and have restricted all the good options to their premium service
4,help you alot to plan your day
4,great app i really like the integration with other apps like gmail and trello etc my only problem is it sometimes doesnt show notifications
4,its great
4,tonyrsuarez penaurree
4,amazing app pretty good to remember you what you should do 3
4,interesting but personally not needed
4,good app but eventually stopped using it as it didnt fit my needs exactly
4,ol
4,im trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good the only feature id really like is to share reminders  is that possible eg if i set a task in a shared list id like everyone to receive a reminder for that task or at least the person who has been assigned as it stands you can only set up reminders for yourself
4,if it wasnt for the fact that the app doesnt offer separate widgets for work profile i personally really need this id give it 5 stars 
4,will be happy if this app comes with time durationother that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks
4,i love the app 8have been usinfg it for quit a while now the only thing i font like is that it only has a list option though i wish to make a morning routine on it please see this and fix it thank you
4,it has been very useful for me
4,its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be useful and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder
4,adding habit tracker would be useful
4,love the app but frequent changes to the ux are frustrating i manage to get used to changes develop some muscle memory and more changes come the new snoozing experience is very slow it may be flashy but its just painfully slow its an added inconvenience please at least make it an optin feature
4,this is my favorite todo type of app its gorgeous on an oled display but i really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists to start a good habit i find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl but even better is tracking how many times i actually did after a week and when this app allows repeat events with notifications but doesnt track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on cal or google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore
4,easy to use interface premium account links into other apps
4,relocate the delete task  mark as done tabs i have a galaxy note 10 and quite likely w other phones when i motion to press my navigation button on the bottom right or the open application button on the bottom left i am frequently accidentally tapping the mark as done or delete task tabs and have to to manage or recreate my my task details that i was already working with aside from being increasingly frustrating aggravating and annoying this becomes a time waster
4,honestly needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for i tried out the free trial the deal breaker for me was the fact that i cant set custom alerts for calender events maximum i can do is 2 days before event why cant i customize it ie 2 weeks or 10 days then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching other than that its a nice productivity app love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar
4,nearly perfect for daily usage is there a way for widget do display tasks hours i think this would be massive help for the users
4,clean simple interface generally fast and easy to add things as i think of them howeveri wish the app didnt think it was so smart i find the autospelling annoying putting in 810 ft electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as august 10th and the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories changing the categories for shopping lists is not easy to manage and why do they show up under tasks at all
4,a perfect app to prioritize daily tasks yet the ui is still not up to mark
4,99 percent love this app i would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another its annoying to other people nearby when im using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs
4,great tool i use it every day theres a bug however thats very annoying im on galaxy note 9 when i move the items theres 80 chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the someday list its very annoying and time consuming this is the sorting mode by time additionally when i choose this mode majority of items belonging to various lists unfortunately will not be sorted by date  time so id have to move them manually please fix these issues
4,nice app foe reminder
4,great app very usable lots of featuresbut 36 a year for premium thats almost as much as i pay for my premium password manager and thats much more complicated and costly to develop and maintain this is a great app but theres no way im going to pay that much
4,nice app very useful
4,easy to use and very straightforward no fuss just works perfectly with timely reminders
4,helpful app thanks for the good work
4,anydo is gradually becoming my daily tool for managing my schedule tracking customer debt position it is a rewarding experience for d money
4,i reinstalled 5 times but isnt working basically it isnt singing with any of 3 methods plese fix it i am unable to use such a good application
4,the app lacks tools to view how good i am keeping up with my daily habitrecurring tasks
4,very good planning organizer but theres still few bugs here and there in the grocery list why i cant open the completed lists its always close again after 1 second please fix
4,very nice
4,great app but needs work
4,best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw as far as a todo list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want it is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you that is my major complaint but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent the layout is a little messy but the smart grocery grouping is nice
4,this app is great  i mean really it is you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isnt a bad thing  its just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible  hence the 4 stars  connecting to a student service such as unidays would increase influx of student users
4,goood
4,theres no search option for mobile version even i already have the latest version
4,so far so good i just dont like the fact that it has payment to get full features and its quite expensive
4,great app for tracking tasks could use some work on gesturefinger detection for example i will always accidentally close the text field for a new note when trying to hit save pro version is good but a little pricy for the benefits
4,its a very good appthe only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thingit dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened however i have already given all the notification rights dear anydo team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings thanks
4,good note
4,it is great but it would be better if the sort by time feature is really sort it by time not only today tomorrow and upcoming it is really inconvenient if in the upcoming tasks it is not sort by time
4,so far this is the best app i have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want i highly recommend you to try this app
4,it suddenly quit syncing ive tried logging off and back on again with no luck when i try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced just noweven though none of the things i have added show up never had this problem before if i cant get it resolved i will remove app and find something different very frustrating update i did a force stop on the app and it seems to be back to normal it works for what i need shopping list but isnt the easiest for rearranging the list and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult
4,this app really help me
4,how to disable the everyday 9am reminder to keep a reminder honestly dont need it thats just a noise
4,no popup reminders because we use planner as we forget
4,the grocery lists dont work on huawei p30 pro after your last update the different list sections fold and unfold by themselves it became impossible to use them fix it and ill give you 5 stars again thanks for the follow up i edit the review to 4 stars by now for the good customer service waiting for the big to be fixed
4,increase my productivity helps me to remind and also the price for premium version is also very less
4,it helped me
4,i love this app it was the one i narrowed down to after having downloaded several todo apps however i wish it had just a plain note taking feature for day to day things to remember without it being attached to a todo item i also wish the interface was slightly easier to manage there are a couple fixes that would increase the apps ability to be intuitive for the user an easier way to undo checking off a list item being able to view the agendas differently ie calendar and tasks
4,love this app but i wish i can add due date for my task
4,très pratique 
4,are the tasks created in this apo visible in google calendar if yes how to set that up
4,very good app for manage the things easy to use
4,i can hardly give up on this app it is so intuitive even though there are still things to improve 1shortcut to grocery list 2displaying time of the task in the widget
4,its good and does the job
4,i started with the subscription primarily because of the nlp does it support recurring tasks with nlp  the integrations are awsome
4,great app for goal makers but there are some premium features  please make them free to use its a humble request
4,subscribe by hi iam vimal
4,had an issue but it was handled right away
4,great app for planning my day
4,its simply the best  
4,missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me i must have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion ex if i have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days but i actually go 15 days before completing it i dont want to be reminded again in 5 days i want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever i last completed it its unfortunate because i love everything about this app but wont subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added
4,i just like this app for its widget i didnt pay for the full version so i uninstalled im coming back because the widget look exactly how i need it to look i wish i could just install the widget honestly its my favorite
4,really useful and well designed app  only thing i feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget
4,do i need to pay
4,great app it makes my family and me do specific tasks i would give it a 5 star review but sometimes the notification doesnt pop up at all
4,very good app but i am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time i leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying
4,i m new to used
4,i think that a bug when i set tag for the goal they sometimes disappear
4,timely
4,excellent to help get organized to dos listshavent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize u
4,simple and useful liked the widget too
4,good app simple easy beautiful design bright colors auto backup to cloud sync with calendar it has two subscribe plans free account and premium
4,the app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription which i did and paid th 15 it requested but a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so i basically paid 32  that is a scam and unless i get my 17 euros back im gonna keep the rating at one star edit issue was solved and i got a refund for the extra money that was charged alls well that ends well
4,would love to have been able to plan out a week and see it rather than having today tomorrow and upcoming i use the calendar feature a lot though and it is super useful
4,this app is good i use it daily and it runs my life i have too many tasks though and anydos plan my day feature is good at forcing me to postpone stuff to next week repeatedly pls add a built in optional eisenhower matrix tagging system  tag each item with a quadrant label add a matrix view option to view all todays tasks in quadrant view with filters for specific list only or all items its hard work retyping any do items into other apps to view like this
4,very practical and usefull application
4,nice app which reminds us our tasks and events
4,i like thid
4,useful
4,boo
4,this could be an awesome app it has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app i have reported these issues to the apps tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions the latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically i put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason i have other issues but no moreroomher
4,helpful 
4,useful app but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time it will delete times that are part of my reminder for instance if i want to say go to a meeting at 330 it will delete the words at 330 and set the remind to 330 so if i wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was i cant see it anymore too bad this option cant be turned off
4,can anyone explain anydo moment and plan my day option in the app
4,update tags have started syncing back again tags do not sync between the mobile and desktop app i am a premium user and i put in a ticket about the issue after frequent back and forth over the email the issue hasnt been resolved yet i will update my rating after the issue has been fixed
4,integrates well with my work flow i had difficulty in understanding the my lists so instead i listed my projects insteadworks now integrates well with what i do and the tags differentiates similar project lists i accidentally deleted my shopping list when i really wanted to remove some itemsbut its growing on me
4,is this a free app or have to subscribe  pay to use beyond 7 days
4,only one suggestion an option for big tasks sometimes i have a big task that i will complete over multiple days and it would be cool to be able to check off a little bit at a time
4,this is a good app
4,great and i liked it more than todoist
4,best to do list apk i have ever used
4,alot of great features and cry informative and reminds you as well  great for me thumbs 
4,another app that whats my info by having me sign in edit i rethought my 1  as i dont want to sync just use doesnt mean the app isnt good
4,not always where it should be does not always popup when set on samsung galaxy 9 very few aps rate 5 stars as very few have no problems at all 5 stars woould say it works perfectly from my perspective
4,it was perfect until the new update on huawei p20 lite more precisely with the short cut widget on a main screen please sort this out thanks

5,farhan myao 
5,superb 
5,use this app every day the only problem is that when you place an item to do in a specific place on a specific day the item jumps to the top of the day or to the bottom of the list by itself and you have to replace it

5,cheap paid version covers all u need to maintain a todo list
5,good remind me to check
5,rathergood
5,excellent customer service and very reasonable staff they tried to reach me within a week their responses were very clear and not once did they blame me for any issues i had run into overall a great experience the app itself is nice as a todo list or to organize your numerous tasks by due date categories as well as location
5,the 1st october update has an issue in widget the repeated tasks remain on top despite you mark then done for today
5,i love this app and i cant start my day without it but lately with the new updates i got lost with my tasks list the feature of having today tomorrow and upcoming tasks had been gone which is not good at all i stopped using the app actually i hope the management of this app will look into this issue and fix it otherwise i will need to look for another app
5,intuitive and motivating way of zooming through your task lists
5,the bestpop up reminder is useful as it constantly pops up at the specified time and you cant avoid it until you reset the time and datethis is useful
5,class
5,best app i have found
5,good and the most important thing its free to use and the basic feature is more than enough for me been using this for 3 years keep it up
5,i love this app it really helps me manage everything in my life
5,nice easy way to track tasks in different parts of your life
5,it is absolutely the best tool
5,excellent
5,only thing that could make this better and maybe im just too dumb to figure out lol how to make it workis if as long as the apps open you could just talk into your phone and say like task event instead of having to stop and type it you know but thats my two cents i still love it thank you
5,so far so good i just download this to help my husband be more organized
5,i like this app for the most part loads of different plugins however if you want to change the date for your reminder from the default date it takes 7 taps seven that is not great ux and needs to improve i miss the wunderlist style smart date adding update the new smart date feature makes this a 5 star app for me
5,new navigation is far less convenient than the pre update there should be an option to revert it update thanks for listening updated to 5 star for the reply
5,just do it
5,great app
5,the best app everworth my money for subscribing cause im a student and its really help me to manage my day
5,i adore this app for an absentmindedprofessor type like myself having everything i need to stay on track and show up all together in one place that can be accessed across platforms is an absolute lifesaver the ui is really well designed as well highly recommend
5,excellent app especially for focused practise
5,awesome app
5,great update
5,2012 review been looking for a simple to do app with drag and drop and this is the best
5,very good superb app
5,thanks for your help  if i may i would suggest that you work on newly added tasks  it would be much more convenient if they didnt end at the bottom of the list thank you in advance
5,op
5,enjoying this app works offline and gives you daily reminders to help you get things from your mind into a list format and encourages you to work through them in one day or whenever you can
5,wonderful application
5,love it gives me everything i need and let me do a monthly subscription so that i can have the few extras that you get with the paid version free or paid are worth it
5,very nice app
5,cursor missing often 
5,goods app

5,awesome
1,reminder isnt part of standard app needs upgrade
1,reminders are a premium feature you have to pay for this should be basic
1,using this app for atleast 5 yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature  i mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but thats unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start goodbye todoist edit after reply so you mean me  every other person who is complaining are all wrong reminders were never premium until some time ago i was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan have courtesy to not lie atleast 
1,i was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this come on todoist reminders should never be a premium feature in a task management app
1,i was super happy to download this app but that i soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your todo list
1,i would give todoist more than five stars however you keep ignoring users for enabling them to show completed tasks by default is just irresponsible please add an option to always show completed tasks
1,horrible most of it you have to pay even to put a simple reminder
1,why do i have to create an account and sign in for a simple to do app hella sus
1,no reminder options for free version of this app how can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for my alarm clock would be better than this app sorry i dont recommend
1,lack of reminder in free version
1,i dont liked becous it is not have the time in my tasks day 
1,i will increase one star each day it will help me achieve my goals
1,developer holds notifications as ransom for a monthly payment would be acceptable for a small membership fee but i have to pay for all of premium just to get notifications the whole point of a todo app no thanks
1,constantly buggy ive used this app for five years and they are always pushing bad releases right now there is a crash expanding lists which would have been found with some quick testing several years ago i filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists every few months i check in and out still isnt fixed the web app is not letting you expand sections the windows app was scrambling the order for months they must do zero quality control
1,why is alarm feature premium its the most basic utility someone expects from a todo app
1,problem with new update since the latest update the app keeps crashing everytime i try to expand a tasks subtasks using the built in down arrow button on the right side of the screen please fix
1,12 hours just 12 hours i had this app received 6 emails for todoist why do you think it is acceptable to bombard me with email on top of the email issue to make any real use of this app you have to sign up for the premium service wont be coming back uninstalled and you been added to my junk email list pathetic
1,doesnt nofication me
1,cant use it if notifications dont work wont pay if i cant full feature testlets take this corolla for a test drive we can pretend its the supra you imagine it might be but first pay us to find out where you were just imagining vs how it really workslol too bad genuinely need a good working productno thanks it always requires mindless divulging of my banking info you cant have that if you have a product you trust let me see itif i like ityou can have my banking info lol
1,for getting something basic of having reminder is a premium feature in this app which does not make any sense to a reminder app
1,very simple check list application if you dont pay no teminders no comments nothing also theres no even taking simple notes stuffs just checklist and and sub task if you want very basic use it but tick tick ist best one sorry guys its reality
1,i like the concept but it is very complicated specially entering recurring tasks or editing
1,really push notifications and notifications in general as a premium feature in a to do appi know you need to make some buck out of this masterpiece but did you really had to restrict the feature people use to do list apps for
1,cant use for reminders so what good is this app for
1,requires sign in lol no
1,on free version cant even set a specify time for a task can only set a date nor set a reminder whats the point of a to do list app without these functions uninstalled
1,need to pay 36 for gerring reminders the most basic feature of a todo app its like ordering the most expensive gourmet dish at a 5 star hotel and then the hotelier asking for additional money to add salt to the food lol better to use microsoft to do and lot of others
1,this app is a joke they want you to pay for simple feature like reminder whats the purpose of free app then make it all paid
1,no reminder alert for free version
1,why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app what dev you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that ridiculous uninstalled just needed a to do list app as simple as that
1, notifications 
1,not intuitive i swear items have disappeared if you want to see what you have already done you have to pay for premium no thanks back to using keep
1,not so great app apart from its natural language input only recently added kanban view but lacks any basic requirements like reminders in the free version also the android widget hangs almost always never gets updated
1,very bad app does not work
1,via google assistant not good i get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not google assistant my first experience via google assistant has been horrible to say the least the voice assistant in this app hes badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what i was trying to do as simple as create a task complete a task read task list it was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes
1,i didnt get even the access to add lables and reminder which done for free by many others i look forward for doist to include at least lables and reminders with the free plan i really loved but without the mentioned features in the free plan i dont want to make it my to do list app
1,all functionality comes with premium account only shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version
1,good design but when you uncheck items on a list it doesnt put them back into their original order making it pretty much useless
1,reminders are a premium feature for some ungodly reason they are a must for a todo app whats point of writing it down if you keep forgetting it
1,datamining rubbish
1,it is reliable the app itself is great i give one star for the price only condering my phone have reminder app that is free and built in this app is really just burning my money thanks but no thanks
1,downloaded the app and added a bunch of items and a couple of categories opened it back up a few hours later and everything is gone
1,ridiculously complicated
1,spam
1,for sure this app is good enough but after a year of usage they added reminder feature to a premium access without reminders your app is useless thanks a lot even comments went to premium completely useless app
1,this app does not work on my smartwatch i am not able to log in
1,starting out this app was ok but then i started noticing how limited this is for the free version only 10 projects and where did my completed tasks go those should not disappear until i manually delete them a week into using this and the workflow i was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up these are recurring tasks i do daily i dont know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for daily but its lame
1,extremely complicated to use cant understand a thing good app but it needs a whole tutorial because it does so much
1,keeps spamming your email even after you uninstall the app with marketing emails no i dont want your app i did not like it i did not subscribe to you email subscriptions get lost
1,doesnt actually store any notes
1,used to be my favorite apps but sync bugs drove me crazy too many times auto replace link with title made me mad cancelled subscription  uninstalled
1,i am colour blind and dyslexic not able to read anything i cant zoom in and i need to pay in order to see the colours better update as i said i would have to pay the app in order to have the right fonts and colour so i can actually read and make use with it ive tried wenote and its the app i need without having to pay premium
1,ive tried a dozen task list apps in the last few days and many before that looking for certain features i dont know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it no skip login option nowhere did i see the creatorsreviews say an account is required even for startingbasic use one star nonweb noncollab nonpremium features should be accessible without account then i finally read 1 star reviews now glad i didnt sign up apparently the spam emails never cease
1,worst most useless app ive had the misfortune to try literally zero point in having this over google calendar dont waste your space its useless you cant have recurring tasks everything is behind a pay wall avoid
1,i cant do the things i want  like setting alarm
1,nobody is responding to my support email it has been days what is this i need help all my info is gone and nobody is doing anything for daaaayyssssss
1,everything was a purchase immediately after downloading bummer
1,please allow more complexity in setting recurring tasks for example daily routine go to bed at 10pm ev weekday and go to bed at 12am ev fri sun its frustrating having to create multiple tasks for the same recurring task just because i want it set to a different time will leave my review at 1 star and upgrade to 5 once fixed look forward to any updates from devs on this one
1,lol greedy app devs they charge 36 annually or 48 if you select the monthly option if you get the premium version itll allow you to receive pushnotifications for a scheduled task like to set a timer  alert for something on your list uninstalled for 40 the app better be making you breakfast in the morning
1,warning re this app got premium followed instructions to integrate wcalendar wvpn active got security alert minutes later that an attempt was made to login to my email account wmy password had to hustle to protect my account thank you google for superb alerts shame on you todoist for open back doors
1,this is the to do app with the best features or just the features i personally need however my recurring tasks keep disappearing which is simply unacceptable behaviour for a to do app
1,you will be asked to upgrade to a premium just for the sake of adding reminders well that is not satisfying reminders should be available just in the beginning
1,fighting the input method rather than getting stuff done natural language will no way allow me to set a task called register for 3 oct sat test for this friday something simple as adding a note requires premium im going back to todo
1,too expensive ticktick is better
1,too complicated and not well organized
1,it started to send emails asking me to add go running or make coffeei wanted a todo list that i could share with my wifenot another wife telling what i should be doing
1,what good is a todo list app without a reminder why would you make the most important thing a premium feature dont download this app its useless
1,app is not starting just showing blank black screen
1,great app but the fact i cant see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if im free on specific day in the future insteas i need to check week by week is a deal breaker although i did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app
1,minimal features to force premium purchase this app advertises itself as a an alternative to microsoft for people forced to migrate from wunderlists wunderlists was an excellent fully featured list app with reminders repeatable tasks folders to group similar lists and the ability to share any list with anyone via email or the wunderlist app todoist allowed import from wunderlist and mostly supported these features until summer 2020 update made every useful feature only be in premium
1,this app lets you create 1 list then when you go to create the next one you cant without paying
1,cannot delete account tired of getting email notification everyday worst app ever
1,it is the worst app in my life 
1,charges for service not received can not contact
1,not as good compared to other apps not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features
1,tddr you have to register you get blasted with emails free version is as good as free native app its not clear what features you get if you spend money its disappointing most features are behind a pay wall which is fine  id be more than happy to pay if i understood what those features are and having used the app i still dont know also you have to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails which is by far the most annoying thing this app does
1,everything is a premium feature everything else is a basic list
1,worst only useful when you are using premium
1,too complicated so uninstalled but still getting unasked for and annoying emails every day
1,you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib 
1,in daily tasks if i tap once on yesterday it becomes tomorrow where is today
1,moneygrubbing app that charges premium price for features that other apps offer for free i dont see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it ad supported is better than this slick dump  at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app that being said just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it
1,daily emails cant even see my important emails because of spammers like you
1,not really usefull too difficult to use
1,bad reviews are a real turn off for me
1,what good is a task management app if it cannot give reminders
1,without paid membership there was no use of this app so guys dont download it
1,you want me to pay you monthly so i can have a reminder ahahaha you must be out of your mind
1,poor support response or lack thereof you cant fully delete a history so i had to create a new account been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over have followed up and still no response very disappointing ref no 507634
1,can i rate it zero i spent time explaining support that new widget doesnt follow anymore default system android theme before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from most likely outsourced support is all i got note 10 plusandroid 10june security patch edit i do not use any custom launcher running stock firmware totally
1,glad i only selected 1 month they try too much to make a sleek design that its counter intuitive especially for repeating tasks
1,this app will send spam everyday even when you block them
1,sends lots of emails you cant choose a duration for your tasks its only limited to a day  its good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know its not over due  also the user experience is too complicated
1,i deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday its a waist of time anyway
1,reminders are a premium feature in a todo app really
1,awful cant barely open it up just black screen on the main activity and thats it no reboot or reinstall helped fix asap
1,sends mails claiming monthly payments of 4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs 7 and also the app is quite crappy without premium and premium at 4 would still be too expensive for what you get
1,every thing is for premium users
1,required me to sign in to use it pass
1,without premium features its just garbage what have kept you guys from removing the free version from play store
1,app not starting on my xiaomi mi 9 se miui global 1106 just a black screen the chrome app does work clicked on add to home screen from the website but i really wanted to use the widget very disappointing
1,worthless u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it wont remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership lame instantdelete
1,way too expensive for the premium features while i dont mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track todo items for far less money
1,reminders are a premium feature which is what i needed this app for it really sucks that i cant use reminders for free i have to continue the search for a good reminders app
1,now you cant even see the todays completed tasks without paying premium seems like how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app this is a todo list its not like youve solved a new problem produce content or provide any significant service responseedit currently you can only see by project or subtasks but not by todays tasks seeing todays completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day

1,the company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced without it its just a list tool with inconvenient ux limited possibilities of organizing your tasks absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium would not recommend to anybody  there are tons of better tools
1,bug bug bug bug bug please dont tell me these bugs are features because i am a android programmer too
1,log in required
1,the recent update is kinda trashy it no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when i type tomorrow or on 8th june along with the task
1,no free trial cant even try it junk then they spam you forever
1,i need to pay just to use reminder damn never using this app again so money hungry
1,terrible for free use cant even schedule reoccuring events all at once have to reenter everything each time they occur when you have a lot of things that happen every day several others once a week still more at other intervals this app is useless unless you pay
1,no options to repeat a task why else would i want a to do list might as well use a pen and paper
1,no reminder option why u showcase it in ad when its a paid service
1,i just installed the app and ran it to see how i liked it for my taste way too crowded ui then i started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user which is to add a task i was annoyed so i uninstalled it the email notifications continued i had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task i never created from an app i am not using unjustifiable behavior
1,have to pay 4mo if you want the reminders to work i have add the reminders are the 1 thing i need in a todo list
1,cant work effectively on the free version
1,was looking for a replacement for wunderlist and found this app looked like a great alternative to wunderlist installed the app and started to setup bill reminders only to find that thre primary reason fir a to do app is reminders is only available for 36year really no thank you
1,you create good think bt every option you when i use just close it and subscription to much price 350 par month os is really
1,reminders are premium features now means app is completely useless need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now great 
1,putting remindernotification as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless uninstalled
1,the old navigation was better especially on desktop i miss being able to edit directly now i have to go through more steps
1,ive used the new major redesign for a month or two now and its definitely a step back especially on desktop web editing is such a chore now i hate the popup
1,i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didnt use much at that time now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade please help
1,what mess cant undo a task if pop up is disappeared this app is too overrated lean from ticktick
1,i dont need my card to set the reminder
1,2 out of 3 features require premium no i am not going to do that
1,it is impossible uninstall this one
1,reminders is a paid feature what a joke
1, every time i put a task in it removed the number in the name and put it in my inbox why
1,really difficult app to use loads of problems and shortcomings for example theres no calendar so one cant go back to the day a task was set ill give it another week or so but if i havent got to grips with it by then i will delete the app this app is far too difficult to use for my little brain iq 147 so i have uninstalled it
1,reminders feature behind in app purchase seriously thats the most basic function of to do list no way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders
1,subscription for reminders 5 well its fine i will move to google tasks
1,the smart schedule feature was removed without notice until thats fixed to me the app is like any other todo app ive started to look elsewhere
1,worst
1,will never touch this app again tried twice  on both occasions ive regretted it considering alternatives like ticktick or even microsoft todo i dont know why you would actually pay for this not worth the money support is also condescending and incompetent its all good though  you got my money 
1,basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade and it costs 3200 rupees in india thats how much we pay for an entire years electricity bill or groceries for a whole month way too expensive for such basic features nkt worth it useless app
1,too hard to use no tutorials make it worse
1,anything beyond keeping a simple list including reminders is paid
1,seems pretty fancy but 32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free for a to do list app yeah no thanks
1,baad
1,many features are available just for premium
1,garbage
1,time reminder available to to premium only  really   pretty desperate to earn some bucks 
1,looks like it would be a nice app but basic functionality like setting a reminder is an inapp purchase
1,reminders are behind a paywall
1,used to be affordable now more expensive than us pricing
1,one of the key premium features of this app is labeling which unfortunately doesnt work properly when i try to move a label to a shared section the app crashes additionally there is an inconsistency between android and ios in how the labels work in android i can see the whole list of labels even without tasks on ios a label is deleted when there are no tasks marked with the label this together makes sharing labeled tasks with my wife really annoying
1,subtasks are completely useless if you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all it just does not work a powerful todo list and googles keep app with checkboxes has better functionality
1,boring
1,pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost 4  55 monthly immediately uninstalled ill stick to anydo for now premium is almost halfprice
1,everything included in premium feature  only frame work is there
1,widget not loading
1,i spent hours trying to get my wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success looks like it might be a decent app but guess ill never know
1,no notification on free version 
1,worthless uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder this is the basic goal of the app you cant make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads
1,it disturbs when they send unnecessary emails
1,the natural language thing is a gimmick and a nightmare to use simple tools would be so much easier despite paying for premium just to get reminders it took me almost 10 minutes to set a recurring task and it still didnt automatically set a reminder ive been patient ive tried ive read and reread all the rules spent hours trying to learn everything but it still doesnt work it obviously works for most people but i found it to be an overcomplicated and frustrating waste of time
1,i am using this app for years premium version until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now wrote to support without any reaction dont recommend
1,i dont like this
1,basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall
1,an outright scam for absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats
1,guys what is a task limit why its not the way it should be
1,free or trail version has nothing you cant set a reminder for your tasks
1,everything behind a pay wall
1,pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks you have to pay for reminder label comments or for atleast the dark theme
1,reminders the most basic of features is premium in this app
1,reminders are a paid feature thats one of the most basic feature of a to do app why even bother to have a free version this is strictly a paid app
1,there are no recurrent feature reminders feature is premium
1,please revert to your old version  interface the new widget has made the app completely unusable it used to be my favorite task management app and now im searching for alternatives on the verge of uninstalling it ps please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself when you add a new task i have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date
1,after the latest update i cannot find a way to sort my all list by due date any more thus the app is now useless to me
1,everything is premium 
1,requires account its free because they make money harvesting your data
1,once again youve made this worse by redesigning the widget it was fine as it was now i cant select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item if this carries on im definitely not renewing my subscription please restore
1,i couldnt figure out a way to sync with my google tasks and then now the app wont uninstall from my watch
1,subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous i was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app but having to pay nearly 5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd once i saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall i had to stop using it
1,reminders are a premium feature
1,two word  paid mess please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice  just go for a better app
1,dont lock reminders behind a pay wall or if you do make it a 1 time purchase
1,update 042020  this is getting worse and worse still with every update now they made it harder to edit your task  they moved it behind two clicks why seems like this app is moving away from the todoapp for power users to just another todo app same as any other this is the last time i paid for the premium subscription time to move  it used to be the best for power users but after the latest updates the app keeps getting worse and worse i am not really sure who this updates are for definitely doesnt seem like its for its core user group
1,rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear earlier i have experienced that it duplicated tasks this way a basic functionality is broken and i just lost what should i followup today no activity log available as that is a paid feature i guess i will never try that now
1,dislike the latest widget downgrade  the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating not sure how long i will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version
1,anything that calls itself a to do list that doesnt include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless uninstalled
1,i want to schedule a task daily  should i add it every day  whats the way 
1,new android widget is garbage full control yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling
1,mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create disappointed with to this app
1,i will use other app i will not pay
1,not easy to use horrible design
1,needs registration cant use existing caldav task accounts
1,in basic app why cant even add comment its not even basic when it comes to free
1,36 per year for push notification reminders no thanks
1,requires my email no thanks
1,first the app changed my task name then the task just disappeared and was not in the app bad app
1,the google calendar integration is riddled with bugs and it has been this way for months they dont fix it and they are pretty slow on their communication ticktick is becoming very tempting
1,pay to remind really
1,total waste of money
2,i bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list but personally i need alarms and reminders to keep me on track i was looking for one when i found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting i was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function so i uninstalled the app i bet it would work for someone else but not for me
2,this app is ok but it really needs start date functionality their reasoning behind not adding it is terrible
2,team  i took subscribtion but app is not working i try to add task but i cant see the text etc something is wrong
2,not convenient for users
2,reminder is under premium seriously must need unstall
2,love the idea and functionality of the app but it consistently crashes for me luckily it saves the last edits made however it is still hard to use when it crashes so often
2,everything great but you guys have made basic reminder a premium feature very disappointed 
2,just needed somthing to record things i have to do and to remind when i should do them then got hit instantly with a paywall not a cool start tho
2,app is not for me i paid 400 for 1 month of premium service and is still shows i am using the free app i immediately contacted customer service twice and its been more than 2 weeks into the 1 month i paid for and i still have not received a response from anyone at todoist im still trying to figure out how to customize this app to suit my needs but since i dont have the premium app in order to do that i will be uninstalling this app
2,not helpful
2,overrides set task order if priority is not at the same level  your selected chronological order will be ignored without any option to disable this if tasks are completed and restored they go to the end of the list not the position you chose making this inappropriate for projects that are recurrent like mapping out activities of daily living 1 star from me  an extra since order may not be important to others eg for shopping lists
2,if paid account bit costly
2,please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible would be better if it was possible to add top of the list it is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed
2,no reminders in free version and pro version is very costly they should lower their prices according to ppp todo list without reminders is useless i can use any notepad app instead of free version of todoist
2,everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it a simple push notification and you want me to pay for it
2,im really disappointed with the wear os app  the reminders doesnt works as expected i hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup and if i scroll down on the main screen i see no notifications how am i supposed to know what task i was reminded about  i cant add a new task with a due date eg test 2010 because as soon as i type 20 the  button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys  second keyboard page either i use the defaultgoogle keyboard so that cant be the issue  the sync is slow after i added a new todo on the web i had to open the wear os app a few times so my new todo also appeared there could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync
2,when i type some words in the task they just disappear eg sun doesnt allow me to rearrange the tasks under the project this is a basic feature
2,reminder is chargeable service  no point
2,the sound reminders are basic should be on the free version price is absurd just gonna continue with tick tick
2,even after 2 years the sync is still garbage wow just wow
2,earlier it was an excellent app without premiums on reminders and manymany other stuff literally everything was available but with time it got only worse these complicated swipes circles instead of checklists and modern trendy design while neglecting intuituve and easy style and now what i see after a year everything got even worse what happened with you
2,updates have shifted to taking away features you can no longer format text in sections and project names as someone at todoist decided that was simpler im 90 done switching to notion and dont regret it one bit
2,most of its premium
2,app is good enough but drains your battery for that reason im uninstalling it
2,apparently syncs with alexa but i cant get it to work disappointing
2,too complex
2,a lot of functionality but not so simple to use
2,that app is good but i could not benifit
2,i downloaded this app because its one that syncs with our smart speaker however i have recurring tasks some of which are daily and that option does not work at all it works are far as setting them up goes once i mark a task as done it skips the next due date so my daily tasks are only showing up every other day not happy with that at all i am in the process of finding another app asap
2,decent app but forced to pay for basic features not enough customization for tasks
2,i subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with todolist servers so my tasks disappeared rearranged and completely messy i spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again please fix this
2,almost no productivity without premium version
2,sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk have to reinstall and delete account
2,everything is premium
2, cant have more than 150 tasks per project even of you pay  cant have more than a couple a certain number of projects even if you pay  sharing from chrome and hitting the paper airplane button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes todoist and chome   
2,sort by priority is missing
2,the widget was finally perfect so of course someone had to make it less functional because obviously a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isnt a thing that a person should be allowed to have no clearly only a widget thats required to take up more than half the screen will do is there seriously a good reason the widget cant be resized to something sensible any more because i cant think of one and i am seriously frustrated
2,every now and then out of blue it stops syncing across platforms i use last time it was buggy update this time is sfsin no idea why
2,im two years premium subscriber for the app it seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me inability to see all finished tasks by label guys its high time you added this to android and mac doesnt seem any difficult
2,the verge says this is the best todo list app right now welli guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app this app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium one particular major example is the archived projects this is a premium only feature however as folks may missclick and not undo they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list
2,paywall heavy
2,i realy didnt like titack is better to me
2,disappointing
2,normal app the most features on premium account like backup cloud comment labels and reminders too
2,not for me im trying to setup notif take medicine at 4 am need to pay sorry no
2,after using this product for a month on the computer and my phone i have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with the free option isnt as good as other options such as microsoft to do and the paid solution offers little more than these either
2,i came from wunderlist the most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work because completed task are deleted after one day i will look around further
2,after getting the premium subscription i found that windows 10 app doesnt have any app lock mechanism so anyone using the machine has access to todoist id request you to fix these kind of basic things before bringing more features
2,reminders are a premium feature no thanks uninstalling
2,used it for 4 years april they updated it and its now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app why if you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right wrong it opens a new window with sub taks i now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet 2 times instead of 1 productivity or stupidity im changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible bye for now
2,way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked example i got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and todoist app open and when i looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and im left trying to remember wish task it was really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize im uninstalling because of this
2,cost
2,cant really do anything on the free version no reminder no scheduling
2,you need to pay to add reminderalarm which should be a basic feature
2,did i read that right to add reminders to my tasks will cost me 36 per year are you crazy
2,simple function like sort by name isnt working shame
2,meh10 came from wunderlist my wife has the iphone app and it is a reasonably functional app not as fullfeatured but okay this android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience in fact they might actively hate their users
2,im looking for a wunderlist replacement this is nice has some folder features that im using but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane
2,the new widget is terrible even in noncompact view the elements are too small and i can no longer access the main app window from the widget this was possible earlier
2,im changing my review from 5 to 2 im a pro subscriber and love this app but latest widget changes for android are truly terrible i cant click the todoist icon to get the app open anymore because thats gone i cant click the reschedule shortcut button anymore because thats also gone and i cant select multiple tasks to mark done at once via the widget anymore but hey its transparent now horrible update and i hope the team behind this update sees this review
2,too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo there are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version
2,only for singlr use cant assign task and sub task to others
2,y
2,changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and support provides condescending replies regarding the issue
2,i am trying to find a decent replacement for wunderlist todoist is merely okay im vacillating between 2 and 3 stars because the most common thing i need to do always add a task to the top of a list is apparently not possible the most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the bottom of the list not at the top i never want this behavior adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and i have to manually rearrange the list on the web app you can control where to add a new item by using shifta but there is no preference to always do this there is also no way to do shifta that ive found on the android app you have to create a task then manually move it to the top also sorting by date either doesnt work or sorts the wrong way because the newest tasks are still at the bottom i cannot believe that this is the default behavior and that it cannot be set in a user preference i sooooo miss wunderlist
2,not flexible enough for my needs
2,used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable too small to see and there is no way to change the size you also can no longer select multiple tasks or pop out the widget to see multiple days i requested to go back to the previous version but didnt get much response so now im looking for a replacement
2,new update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen the font is smaller and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult please fix five stars otherwise
2,so you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium no still doing normal in everything else
2,it was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange and with new update you cant even open the app from the widget you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon
2,trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article  ive switched to google tasks which is way more intuitive
2,the new update destroyed the widget terrible
2, edit there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date tomorrow is sometimes sent to next week and next week the week after i double checked my datetime settings  good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model i would be happy to pay but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered at least not for my usage
2,new update to the widget makes it so i can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget i actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut you tout a fully operational widget but i cant rearrange my list entries via the widget only the full app menu and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place i really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom i will be trying out new todo list apps now
2,they fixed the crashing issue awesome my impression of the app was 5 stars after that what brings me back though is the latest gui change to the widget 2 stars now they took away the ability to easily select multiple tasks i am considering switching task managers now i do not see a way to restore the old functionality also i used to be able to launch todoist from the widget that button is gone now too i am a long time user ive reached the enlightened rating on the app boo
2,the new widget does not allow me to open the app directly like it could before updates should never remove features knocking my review down  rest of the app is still great
2,why would i pay for this app for reminders its just a goddamn simple feature
2,subscription required just to set a reminder
2,while everything else about this app is good the process of scheduling a task is frustrating half of the time it fails to recognize what im trying to set you should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago that was easy
2,cannot use because of the 299 entry limit my most important list was split into 7 lists the first list segment is full so i cannot add a new entry to the top of it i copied my lists from wunderlist and several lists got split like that if it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full i might have been able to make it work
2,its free forever but reminders are a premium feature hmm im dyspraxic without much money to waste and im looking for a todo list app to help with this without reminders this app is functionally useless to me disappointed that youve opted to contentcarve to this extent and id argue your claim of being free is misleading please reconsider which features to gatekeep because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me less likely to support you financially
2,cant use with vpn i practice information security and prefer to use a vpn whenever i can i use 2 norton  nordvpn not of course at the same time in both usage cases when my vpn is activated it would say there is no connection i have even tried different servers is there a reason that vpns are a problem for your service how is your data management  security does your company view peoples data how do you keep others from being to steal others data because username  passcodes
2,why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point you guys are just a company trying to get rich
2,the interface is very nice and simple however once i got down to using it and setting some tasksfive tasks total about an hour later i went back to the app to make edits but instead saw the list of tasks that i have set were deleted if the app has an issue saving the tasks it needs to be fixed i will change the rating once that bug is resolved
2,reminders are kind of a core feature in a todo list app why should i have to pay for it the app is fine but i cant use the reminders
2,there are better options available i just didnt like the layout and functionality of the app i tried it for a couple of months but now its deleted and i am going to try another
2,reminder requires payment
2,functions fine in general easy drag to subtasks cant adjust the notifications to not go through do not disturb mode bad if you work off shifts cant set timing of notifications in a productivity app scheduling is important reminders require premium seriously ill just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay 3 month overall average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions
2,expensive
2,i was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature i uninstalled would have been great otherwise
2,the main feature does not work  it doesnt remind me about todo with system notification
2,the changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad ux but they introduced many quite critical bugs please fix
2,the widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update please fix it
2,new update is incredibly finicky and makes it difficult to add existing items to projects change dates etc appending a task with project_name no longer adds it to the project it just takes it as a string literal
2,i was keeping track of christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting show completed tasks until today when i went to check and they are all deleted kind of a bummer it was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option but now i have to go through my hidden gift stash which if you are a parent you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time
2,not very user friendly
2,looks great but not useful in free plan and its very expensive
2,yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free
2,i wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
2,it seems like a good app with good features but its not intuitive at all i spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and i could mark it done i try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing the icons are also not intuitive at all
2,the latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks completely changes the old interface with attending bugs out of the blue biggest fan to dead in the water overnight shocker
2,revised review sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out app was so great and so functional for months until a few days ago i was working around the changed now cumbersome rescheduleeditrename tasks process but labels beyond a few characters are hidden now todoist labels was the thing for this app for me with efficiently visually seeinggrouping tasks had made app ahead of many others app needs more display settings thento be usable again
2,the new update is awful i have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days multiselect doesnt work any more and the widget is totally broken rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely
2,گزینه آندو ش میپره
2,every update have been a step backwards all the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so the last straw for me is now you cant add things quickly to default inbox project anymore now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project even though i just want to add quickly to the default inbox making the quick add widget useless now also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy monthly cost instead of one time
2,the premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other todo apps you can not even use the labels tags function without paying if you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you
2,guys you created a great app that id been using for years but the latest update is weird modal views when selecting a single task why do i need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling no ability to choose multiple tasks only by top menu  select tasks strange icons that all makes me really sad rolled out to the previous friendly todoist 
2,sep 2013 took almost 1 year for decent reminders is still annoying to click twice to view the notes not very productive oct 2019 with new interface the notes disappeared the interface is just a copy of wunderlist or ticktick what is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality reminders and notes for nothing
2,not a fan of the new foundations update you promised so many new features and didnt deliver any of them the update to subtasks didnt fix some of the core issues with them
2,to many features locked behind premium
2,new layout and functionality is no bueno dont like the interface for rescheduling tasks please fix
2,would even pay  advertise but i am not able to see in one view when future stuff is taking place
2,why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date can this be fixed
2,versão free não faz quase nada quase enganação falar que o app é gratuito
2,i tested a few task apps and this one looked promising at first but very quickly i hit the paywall even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels im going to use trello instead
2,you cant have your to do list as notifications
2,i hate when the things are no clear basic features as reminders are in the premium membership
2,kept getting an unknown error has occurred please try again later  tried on several devices on my t3 connection had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one uninstalled sad cuz it looked great in re devs reply yes i did that i made sure it was plugged in and turned on too i did take a look at the apk and ive found an alternative for me for right now thanks
2,it just feel old
2,great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw every time i create a task it goes to the bottom of the list i always want the task at the top so i can see it thats the whole point of using a to do list so i have to drag the task one by one to the top makes me crazy
2,almost every feature requires a premium account for 36 per year its not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan
2,you have to upgrade to get notifications
2,seems like a good tool but almost nothing that i actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription id happily puchase the app or do a free trial period but honestly it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall especially when they try to give a discount for a years sub before you even really get to try the features nope
2,its good for making lists but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium its just not for me
2,great app alas im constantly reminded that hey btw theres a paid version which has the functionality youre looking for    this is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesnt make any sense plus hey its expensive
2,i tried the free version i liked the way that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself but the free version doesnt support calendar and for me this is a big minus i prefer to use google task app that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task
2,tedious and annoying to use went back to using google keep
2,cant make into my calendar
2,no longer able to add note to todoist quickly using google and notetoself yes you can do it but it takes 60 seconds instead of 10 seconds not sure if this is a google change or a todoist change but it removes one of the most useful parts on todoist i am a long time premium user looking for another tool
2,i used to like this app been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results but its been having too many problems with sync and with failing to load karma data not only that but if you miss checking a box but dont see that omission until the next day theres nothing you can do about it maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good id like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my android but apparently that cant be done and if i delete my online account i delete everything i think i just want to dump this flawed app and see if i can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required
2,fantastic app a critical flaw one touch completion now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you cant find them easily updated july 25 the developer asked me to respond to comment thanks for responding dont fuss on my part 
2,why does my theme switch from dark to light every time i open the app
2,use google tasks instead
2,some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing the options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date project category etc these have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps there is no sorting options or filters on views ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful too many clicks to edit tasks eg notescomments rescheduling
2,i am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasksprojects i have scheduled so i end up missing out on things i want to take care of i have it turned on in settings why is that i utilize the smart schedule tool but still no notification pls help or fix
2,awful uxui  i dont like how you have to use a rigid syntax to set recurrence for tasks i like old fashioned controls but todoist is just trying to be different for no reason was on premium for several months and gave it a fair shot  needless to say i cancelled my subscription and switched to ticktick instead i dont normally downvote apps but this just didnt do it for me and i spent money on it i should have ignored the hype so the fault is mine
2,mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly why can you do it from only projects why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right to much marks is completed allow a simple option on the menu deleting tasks is several options in etc doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating needs some real ux love
2,technically a paid apppay for reminders ui not as attractive as related apps
2,beautiful interface and design unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks as is other top rated to do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker
2,too many premium features
2,notifications dont sync without opening the app
2,its clear to me that this is the best todo app and ive used it for a long time but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as its impossible to use a todo app without them ill be switching to ticktick
2,should tell the cost first
2,the splash screen says the account is free forever but to have reminder of events  tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its 3 per month thats quite misleading response to the developer thank you for responding the main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature best wishes with the app
2,lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget i use todoist for homework assignments and i used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for without being able to see all my parentsub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app i went back to an old apk but then i started getting prompts that the app would stop working if i didnt update i still use it as a grocery list with ifttt until keep is fixed
2,the update got rid of a major tool for me you can no longer press and hold the task to bring up the option to delete it not even sure how you delete on mobile now which is very inconvenient
2,doesnt even come close to wunderlist or anydo unless you pay
2,need to learn more
2,i like the app it works its functional and its great however one thing still strikes me down why the hell are reminders a paid feature seriously whats a todo app without reminders i could use even my calendar or almost any other app and that would too have reminders for free so why should i pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app
2,i have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating before applying the update i had hoped to find documentation about changes found nothing on the todoist website no comments in reviews update is attempting to be pushed wheres the documentation
2,fundamental problem in their development cycleforce users to update but the value to the consumer doesnt have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update is there not a beta program with participating users todoist thats what you need to fix for everyone elsemy widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until i can remove the complete buttons shrink text have fully customizable widgets or settle on another app but really focus on the root problem
2,lots of emails notifications that you can not stop most of the features you need  including seeing a completed task  are all in the pro version needs payment edit after doist reply i mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists they keep filling my email every day and i could not stop them
2,new lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy app no longer syncs to my computer app which has syncing problems of own since the last update its slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as i paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up i really hope you guys are working to fix the lag the lay out and the syncing problem this last update was a terrible idea
2,dont like the layout not very user friendly and you cant see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced dont recommend there are much better apps that cost much less or are free
2,when you view a project youll no longer see all the tasks in its subprojects  mit diesem kurzen statement wurde ein kernfeature der app einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten workflow auf nachfrage beim support bestätigt dieser dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann wann genau ein ähnliches feature dahingehend kommen wird generell zukünftig hieß es da nur da diese anzeigeweise auch zentraler part mehrer projekte war die ich mit nichtpremiumnutzern teile stellte ich dem support des weiteren die frage ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante folgefeature auch wieder für nichtpremiummitglieder verfügbar sein wird die antwort darauf war dass es egal sei wenn ich ein projekt mit einem nichtpremiumkunden teile da premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können solange man halt eben premiummitglied ist dahingehend also danke für nichts  schade so gern ich die app auch immer mochte so kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten reaktion des supports will ich das auch nicht mehr   edit  die methode von doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht nämlich nicht mit nonpremiumkunden siehe oben
2,it seems like the developer is paying attention to customers which is a good thing hopefully theyll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update the checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete this is a bad bad deal i use todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses if i errantly check off a task it could cost me a lot of money and possibly lose me a client hopefully youll fix this right away
2,have to pay for labels theres no separate sections for different categories on widget
2,very simple design that makes adding a task complex also most useful features are premium
2,it was so good and then the pc version became extremely annoying overnight ill add tasks in a project the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own and sure i can reassign it but i didnt have to before and thats just an annoying waste of time i dont mind waiting for it to get fixed but i might just start looking for a new app which sucks because i really liked this one
2,has become much worse when the sub tasks were removed i liked having categories of my tasks sorted out into the categories please add back in the option to have subtasks show
2,where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 25 years and this app never worked properly for me i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess businesslinehalit try searching your emails i wrote more details in original post
2,please i need help when i try to log in with google in the app it said unknown error occurred please check again in a few seconds ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app but no such luck
2,wunderlist is much better
2,cannot enter how long a task will take which severely limits its use for scheduling
2,i never understand why they never update or upgrade thier bad subtask working under 2 years i am using premium account and managed hundred projects which i seen this app to weak too continue i cannot handle subtask and moving them together that is really problems but they never fixed i think i will change another for next project this is enough thank you
2,it works but way too expense and compkicated than most user will need this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating
2,removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version and the price is way to high looking elsewhere 
2,would be better if the inbox was not treated as a project but rather a scheduling location and that items could be created in the inbox and easily bulk moved to other projects but stay in the inbox to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever tracking would be easier and the app would get a higher rating and i may actually subscribe its a deal breaker for me
2,i tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasnt as intuitive as i like and might be missing some features imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when i specifically turned off all notification settings this app is probably great for people who like to be nagged i dont i like to be organized
2,mahal harus bayar mahal untuk bisa mendapatkan fitur2 penting
2,really liked this app until they started charging for basic functions on a monthly basiswould have been happy with one time charge but not worth 36 a year when there is better for less
2,the free version is very limited
2,difficult onboarding no integration with google calendars documentation is not very clear
2,reminder is a premium feature really the app isnt user friendly
2,its an average app to waste time on and increasing your work
2,looks good until you have to pay 3month to add labels
2,free features are much better in wunderlist app and second best would be anydo
2,the free version has a minimal functionality there more advanced free apps on the playstore
2,the chrome extension is awesome but not the mobile app
2,as someone who isnt interested in task sharing or syncing i find it insulting todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a onetime unlock thats just greedy
2, hampered by the fact that too much of the functional tweaks are paid ones compared to dozens other todo app ive tried and used  seriously the uiux is informative the paid one is very multifunctional yet still as simple as possible and the categorizationtagging feature is a hoot i would sooo use it if not for that fact
2,limited features with the trailfree version 
2,its good to do stuff but it wont let me see the tasks ive completed
2,itemstasks disappear search is hard to use annoying user interface to enter due dates that require you to remember esoteric lexicon to do things like reoccurring dates
2,premium or nothing
2,hi  i am using vivo v5 plus handset i had downloaded todoist for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen  kindly help me in this regard
2,i couldnt find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks
2,puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly
2,the only reason i had premium was because i could get sms notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar
2,worthless contacted support through the app over a week ago and still no reply i paid for the year but i will be cancelling it as paying to have basic features on this app is a ripoff for the customer crazy to think i paid and still get no support go with another app and save yourself the money an the hassle of todoist thanks update they have finally replied so up to 4 stars as at least they got bank to me
2,maybe it works for some people but this was absolutely the worst to do list app i have tried every time i opened it therr was a feature blocking my use the ultimate problem was finding no task delete function
2,you cant do almost anything without upgrading to premium
2,there is a bug in this app no matter what i selected the change time zone to pop up kept coming up if this could be fixed i would definitely be interested in using it
2,there is better google keep than this if you need a free one you need to pay to use this
2,يحتاج بال رايق و معقد مو مثل ما اتوقعت وقت ثاني يمكن احمله
2,app deleted my tasks out of no where as well as the app seems to be bloated with features needs to be more sleek and refined i dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features
2,just uninstalled it it looks a great app but one its fundamental features reminder was available only in premium mode
2,no easy way to import or export tasks in a nonproprietary other app eg google tasks compatible format
3,hi can you add secondary filter like currently you provide filter option priority 1 priority 2 etc when we r using a filtered view like view all then all task priority 1 from different projects gets lined up sequentially here if suppose 15 task have priority 1 30 have priority 2 then it is difficult to sort can you please add secondary priority filter like sp1 sp2 sp3 sp4 etc which we can assign to task and then u know we can see proper sorted view any timeline to add this feature
3,full power app sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own otherwise amazing
3,i saw this recommended and tried it i really like the look of the apps widget some of the stuff is free and some is premium i reviewed bout five task apps and this came down to the finals but i dont want one of the features i need being behind a subscription so i will be choosing something i can only pay once thanks for allowing trying this app
3,for the love of god explain me why theres no option to always show the tasks ive done i dont want to go to the main tab to the submenu like why cant i reach todays done tasks from today tab and no option to make them not hidden as soon as a tap it done
3,theres no repeat task daily feature
3,when i open a project then click on the arrow dropdown the app closest otherwise i normally love the app
3,last update introduced a bug that crashes the app when opening sub task menus dont you guys do some bug fixing before updates another problem are the bad apps for windows be it the old abandoned or the new windows 10 one they are just too buggy and unreliable
3,todoist is great no questions about it well built nicely designed regularly updated ive been a premium user since wunderlist was on the chopping block however i realized im paying 36 each year for essentially one feature task reminders additionally 2 users in 1 household on 1 budget pay 100 more for both to use the app i think thats ridiculous so im out
3,it costs an arm and a leg unfortunately
3,the app used to work fine for me until a few months ago i no longer get any notifications ive fiddled with android notification settings app settings reinstalling and so on but nothing worked im able to fire a preview from the app but it doesnt come in on the time scheduled hopefully an isolated issue but i cant rely on this at all anymore
3,i have to constantly resort the items when i add a new item in a list it doesnt automatically sort by date the new item gets put to the bottom
3,it wont notify me
3,very good functionality but let down visually im not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself when you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority which changes the tick circle color but is limited to 3 colours theres no way to change the colour of the text or background you can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task very odd also on the widget cannot remove the today text
3,it felt like too much
3,can you fix the bug where when adding a task the keyboard fills up past the options that lets you select priority and projects its not critical but its annoying to see at a ux level
3,the free tier is close to useless and coming from ticktick i found todoist pricier and work fewer features
3,app is great as a wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money it is not possible unfortunately i wont use this app
3,how can i stop it from sending me the things i enter the app to my email
3,the app is functional and the widget is very handy but the subscription model cost feels a bit much for all of the use i get out of it id be much happier if it was a bit cheaper and when you consider some of the other free options that are out there paying so much for so little feels like a bit of a con
3,only one snooze option i need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm this is an option for just about every other todo app dont understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time respone to developer no it doesnt help when an alert comes up i would like to be able to select how long to snooze that particular alert from a several options not one snooze length forall alerts
3,app crashes whenever i try to edit time of any task
3,suddenly the filter no time no longer works it used to work up to yesterday but no longer does please fix
3,hey folks its an app ive heard lot of great things about but its not opening for me im on redmi note 8 pro can you please look into it thanks ill change the review as soon as it works best of luck
3,ok i waited a long time for this app to run in landscape mode on my tablet no dice reducing to 3 starts until this functionality is added sorry but i cant use this app 50 of the time thanks
3,how to add everydays task
3,i love the app however i recently renewed my phone in china and i need a version that will run without google play services  please make something available so that i may continue to enjoy todoist
3,why arent reminders free 
3,when we add subtask it gets added too slow
3,while adding time to a task asked me to subscribe for premium  i said sorry uninstalling i can pay for an app for extra features but if i am expected to pay just for basic functionality then plz make it a paid app at the first place
3,it took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as may converting to date i simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation i also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the subtasks that i was entering i thought i had to go back to the main menu all the time a simple start here first induction video would be great but the more i practice the better the app feels still orientating early days yet
3,no integration with google assistant will probably leave for more integration of hands free control
3,very good at what it does but doesnt come close to warranting a monthly charge
3,does not integrate with outlook premium version require annual fee with only cosmetic added tools can live with the free version but looking out for better app that syncs with outlook now can sync with gtasks but require integration app by 3rd party pay thru the nose eg 15mth would be good to have 2 way sync for users to leverage on both apps using premium subscription of todoist
3,this app is not so good as a free version you let us make subtask which is great but not able to make a reminder is pathetic for free version users you can make a certain limit for using reminder also it will be great if you add a pomo timer
3,some functions are frustrating i was trying to enter tasks as theyre described in an assignment with things like part a b or c but it always changed anything with a part a to a time if i manually changed it so there was no time it deleted the rest of the text
3,wunderlist was waaay better too bad that one got bought out i need an app that syncs to another phone and that lets me organize things the way i need them this app is okay but they reserve a lot of features for the paid version subscription required not gonna happen ive used this app for several months but im done
3,its good but the layout requires an extra click to get to the calendar week view and thats my favorite view because i want todoist to be my weekly planner if i have to click into the app click the side bar and then click into the calendar view its too much work those three views today calendar view etc i would like clickable like at the bottom always or the ability to swipe between the views
3,nc
3,looks great but no option to save to sd card and i need phone space so have to uninstall
3,its a nice app but to keep in mind your tasks it needs a notification but u have to pay for it thats what i hate in this app coz it doesnt remind u that at what time u have to do a task it gets a little boring while this  sometimes i forget about my tasks
3,good application the free version is very limited since most of the functionality is in the payed version
3,the mobile version is great but is there a reason that the web interface is suddenly so slow and unwieldy its been a few weeks now so im deleting this app and creating lists on a new app in case anyone has any recommendations
3,not that great
3,just learning ill check back later
3,clean simple interface
3,paid version probably is good but free version is seriously restricted does not live up to reviews which i am now guessing are mostly premium users a simple example reminders cost 4 colors included but a simple other one costs etc
3,smart scheduling feature was nice i miss it a lot i was using it for a very long time and i dont think its ok just to remove a feature without giving something similar
3,good app i used it quite a bit until the version changed and became incompatible with my phone
3,reminders and some other features should have been free
3,touch  go plus google assistant stated its not support with devise integration im using a android phone and have the app on it
3,adfree sync with cloud can manage recurring tasks interface not suitable for beginners widget is functional premium is very expensive licence for homeuse missing however the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium greatest mistake no way to backup  export my own data unless i pay dont be greedy  it is my data and you lock it away missing auto backup in the free version is ok but no way to export  download it is a nogo
3,базовый функционал платный
3,not bad but the best features of this app is contain credit
3,update thanks but still doesnt help  could it be phone on huawei mate 10 first review coming from wunderlist main use shared shopping and admin lists with family so have shopping project with sub project for each shop i made the shopping project the home screen but cant see any sub projects and their tasks on android can on mac investigating sections so multiple taps hunting for undated tasks too complex for family frustrating for me ok otherwise
3,ive paid for the app for a few months now i see the smart reschedule feature is gone and i dont feel inclined being a paying customer again
3,it reminds and keep systematic record of daily work
3,works fine unless you want integration with google calendar its evidently broken reddit is filled with bug reports and it seems theyre still working on it i hope it gets fixed soon so i can upgrade to premium
3,i would rate it 4 or 5 star but its just that the main features arent free otherwise you can go for it its an okay app
3,after i updated the app the option to smart schedule disappeared how do i solve it
3,well i thought its the best in the market as they clearly have 13yrs of experience now but i was wrong i so wanted to avoid that ticktick app but theres no alternate to it pros  amazing sync  interface cons  pricy no calendar view or sync available within the app like ticktick no habit tracker
3,i like it
3,this is a simple app and should not have any premium features and yet one of the most important things about an online todo list a reminder notification costs money
3,neither hate it or love it but i hate apps where i have to have a log in
3,the concept is good and its really helpful to have project tabs however its really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear it makes your progress really difficult to track also the subscription price is really expensive it would be better if it was a one time paymenr for full access to the features much like nova launcher i hope to see these changes made so i can support this app knowing i got my moneys worth
3,i liked the app it was missing a few things but it was okay i uninstalled it at one point until i decided if i wanted to keep it but i am still getting notified for the reminders it is incredibly annoying and i cant figure out why edit thanks for the help the problem is now that i dont know what account i logged in with
3,too many clicks to do things you need premium version for reminders
3,im giving only 3 stars coz remainders are not working inspite doing all the troubleshooting methods posted in todoist help help me
3,feedback
3,coming from wunderlist this is the best one i found there is one thing which i find irritating the added item goes to the bottom of the list can you add an option to sort by reverse date that would make it perfect list for me
3,a nice solid basic app for tasks i enjoy the features of being able to have different projects priorities and easy scheduling the push notification doesnt seem to work unless ive recently opened the app so usually i get a notification of the days tasks after ive already opened the app to check manually im on a huawei android thats a big minus unfortunately
3,why too many steps to remove a project
3,simple clear unobstrusive but alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view
3,charging every task
3,an app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app
3,if i select sort by date i want it to be automatic so i do not need to resort items if i mark task done or add new task
3,i used to like this app because it was like writing in a physical notebook but that smooth user experience is gone i feel like they are focusing too much on adding new stuff while the core functionality gets looked over
3,the app itself is great it syncs with the echo to get your tasks without an audible reminder of tasks though its not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month
3,pretty good but too expensive
3,still trying it out
3,app has a lot of features unfortunatelly many not free of charge
3,shouldnt have to pay for reminders
3,clunky for my purposes seemed like a good reminder app i needed a list app i wanted something i could use to save a grocery list not something that tells me hey its tuesday time to go to the grocery theres not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus im coming from wunderlist so i am used to having direct and clean access to a group of todo lists todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders i already have a calendar for that
3,this has been my favorite to do app for years but suddenly the badge app has stopped working on my note 10 if i dont quickly find a way to resolve this ill be looking for another list solution 
3,reasonably decent todo list but the yearly fee is too high for what this product actually provides
3,ok not as easy to add a project after task has been entered a little clunky moving task to next day
3,more steps to go through to access lists that were immediately available on wunderlist
3,its fine the widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all if there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is  the app definitely has its uses im sure but i have to uninstall because we use the widget and if its not functional it doesnt work for us
3,mainly making use of tasks the sub tasks within make my day
3,the new widget made the app almost unusable for me not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way
3,looks good but is for me worthless without notifications and then 34  per month in order to activate notifications is way too much maybe 1  could have been worth in order to move away from microsofts free todo app
3,former version of the app i tried several task manager services before settling on this one lots of good features without unnecessary frills  update  as of april 2020 so disappointed  unfortunately todoist didnt know how to leave something alone that wasnt broken  and added unnecessary frills the functionality has become too layered and cumbersome what used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps my time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks after years of paying for the premium and being one of their top users i am in the market for a replacement there has to be something that is more efficient out there
3,loved todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me cant multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore
3,it was essential to me until the last updates
3,this app is ok the thing that makes it stand out for me is that ive been able to set it up to work with google home as my grocery and to do list however since the update i now cant click into the full app from the widget which is necessary as im unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and i cant seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by priority i can only see how to do it afterwards
3,not sure yet about other features but definitely need the ability to access the full app from the widget
3,i use todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me it has too slim lines even without compact mode compact is ridiculous even though i have small fingers the quick button to open the main app is gone and the worst  it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them bye bye fast rescheduling i am greatly upset it is my main tool for staying on track
3,great app but the update has ruined the functionality of the widget i can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget these are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule the widget could be improved otherwise the app is great
3,great app but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder it doesnt avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder i appreciate that becouse no one will give you his work as a free ok i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which i need
3,i can no longer touch the widget to open the full app what happened i use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen
3,generally pretty good but a lot of awkward design choices no compact mode inefficient use of colors for organization difficulty selecting and moving tasks lack of icon consistency preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself
3,need notes option like wunderlist has get that and youll get a 5 star i have the premium version and we want notes aswell as the chat please just like wunderlist
3,needs registration for online use
3,id be fine with paying 10 or 20 for this app im not fine with paying 3 a month forever to continue using it without being able to use reminders on the free version its no more useful than a 5 pocket calendar and im not willing to pay what theyre asking
3,really great app but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature notifications for a timed reminder
3,a few major issues 1 the addition of sections in projects is nice but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters 2 the sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list the can only be at the end of a task list 3 in filtered view pulling subtasks out of their parent task or noncompletable tasks is ludicrous duplicating them like that is silly at best
3,its pretty good so far im still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps
3,please add app option to put new task at the top of the list for those that are coming from wunderlist
3,reminders should be available for all
3,new to the app so still learning
3,ok for free but limited there are better free apps i want to add details to my diy jobs such as prices links etc i want to easily share and i dont want the task to close every time i talk it trying to interact with it maybe just me but limited and a little frustrating but its free so how can i complain
3,nice app but would like access to a calendar without paying premium price
3,would be awesome if paid but free version too restricted it aint worth it
3,having some problems figuring out what all this app offers still learning it
3,great app but needs to be able to switch accounts easily i have an account for personal life and work life on my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist
3,eu amo este aplicativo e uso sincronizado com o meu google calendar porem de um tempo para cá mesmo com a configuraçao para manter no google calendar as tarefas ja executadas no todolist o evento do google calendar some podem verificar era muito importante pra mim que os eventos continuassem no google calendar minha versao nao é premium e estava pensando em comprar estou com medo de comprar e continuar assim obrigada
3,widget non responsive suddenly u want to tick one item a whole lot of other items tht got clicked
3,repeating previous posts dont bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium its just a shell not worth the space it requires
3,have been having issues since last update when adding a to do it defaults to go to the inbox folder instead of going right to today list so have been forgetting to do stuff because i didnt see it lol 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed edit sane thing happens when i am on today tab and have it set as homepage 
3,layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm reminder etc are available only in premium version
3,being a free version user regularly i can boast about todoists opening yield of tools you receive although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps what makes todoist stand out is the easytooperate platform the simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective enjoyable  my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured it helped me greatly
3,i wish more options be available to free version
3,app is good to use but its premium so not using now
3,great way to start to get organized
3,decent app but not worthy of monthly fees what happened to 1x pro licenses
3,frustrating update plans
3,there is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless i know the smart commands
3,excellent with a single exception ive used todoist for about 5 years and its the best app in its class the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience the one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget on my phone it struggles to load lags is unresponsive wont select tasks properly the list may well go on in short there are so many things which sometimes break it rarely works this is fundamental 5 stars if fixed til then its a reluctant 3
3,its good but i dont like how it makes me feel bad for how unproductive i am but thats just me nothing against the program
3,keeps me focused but i dont want to purchase anything i think it could all be free in my opinion
3,google should make an app like this its calendar app is not intuitive like this giving this app low partly becuz of no integration
3,looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to i would reconsider if the paywall wasnt a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase
3,android widgets dont work anymore clicking on done circle but nothing updates only by restarting the phone removing and readding widget to screen uninstalled
3,the app is good and ive switched to it from ticktick but then i switched to microsoft todo because of the design mainly but thats not the only thing dont get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd maybe fix the design add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all its great
3,a good app although disappointed that i cant repeat a reminder without paying
3,please provide undo and redo for all actions
3,phone samsung galaxy j7 star i just started using the app ill upgrade or downgrade accordingly
3,i recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription i like the app but i have two issues that are hindering its functionality the first is that the notifications slate quite buggy i have 3 different daily tasks which ive set to notify me when they start and i only receive my notifications sometimes the second is that my workweek is sundaythursday and i found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a nonstandard workweek
3,super app with horrible widget you can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget and its gone without you even noticing it free apps have better widget honestly
3,its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing can prioritize list as well great little app 112019 edit hoping like other folks that they undo the changes this app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time cant do that anymore also used to be able to just type repeat everyday repeat every monday wednesday and friday etc it now seems like only sometimes that works
3,very long time user latest updates are making things harder subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and dont seem to reappear when parent task is due again example i have a weekly todo titled groceries with grocery items i need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task whereas before i could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when i go shopping again its now completely gone
3,not user friendly free version very limited
4,will this be available for computers soon
4,its a great app thank you i wish it would let me to write time and cost of each task i list so i could calculate how much i need to invest also it would be nice if i could organize my tasks based on priority and change their priorities if necessary
4,уведомления не приходят вроде для уведомлений использует push через google services но если запретить todoist работать в фоне уведомления не приходят другие программы telegram календарь почта в тех же условиях работают отлично
4,fine app but still not install due to hard working of todoist team i give good rating
4,would be 5 stars for sure except i cant add a task to the top of the list it is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift and they do know about the idea per the forums love everything else
4,please add support to add a task at any position something like add task belowabove this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version
4,really like the app but ive found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view for some sections the tasks dont appear and the add another task button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position
4,it is a great app id give it 4 12 stars if i could my only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications
4,this app helps me alot in tracking and managing my different jobs
4,this is really helping me be organized
4,me esta gustando el sistema que usa
4,simple and intuitive
4,the last update is a win the new karma  productivity interface are top notch keep improving this already awesome app for eventually reaching the perfection update love the new black theme this thing is beautiful keep it up
4,good view and easy to use
4,it almost perfect it is missing a selection tool where you can select more than task and delete them at once also there is no way i can turn a normal task to a sub task to other normal task
4,this is a really helpful app for personal use i like just having basic to do lists for each day i would like a better calendar view though so i could use it instead of google calendar i am trying to build habits and routines and this app is good for setting recurring tasks
4,pretty good app but crashes sometimes if you do something unexpected editcontacted you with a crash description
4,intuitive and easy to use
4,its a gr8 app very useful for daily planners but i would suggest it to have even weekly as well as a monthly planner
4,the best todo app i have used for quite some time its intuitive has lots of functionality and is as simple or as complex as you need it to be you do need to opt for the premium subscription to get the most out of it but the free version is still one of the best out there
4,helps keep your day on track
4,its really good but is there a way to create a task which repeats itself after certain period of time say every monday just like google calendar
4,this is a great tool to keep track of task lists i like that it is available on android and ubuntu it is fast stable and easy to use im reading atomic habits and plan to use the tool to track all my tasks no more google calendar or written to do lists
4,really love the app as it keep me on time and improved my productivity too
4,it helps me keep up with daily chores having the reminder emails is a plus
4,good for tasks
4,this is a great app with one major downfall the completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks by default it should stay on the list in a striked out state it is important to know the tasks which i completed on the day hope this is fixed soon
4,simple intuitive effective
4,basic functions work all well good ui and sectionings of works will get you through the basic needs
4,really helps productivity the email prompts and alerts are a little annoying but really helpful application which keeps my life organised love the link to google calendar
4,i like that everything i need to do is right in one app with a reminder loving it it also allows lists withing the list you are making
4,review update its a good thing i put my subscription renewal date in todoist as a task because they dont send you any notification that your subscription is running out
4,im in love with this app however being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husbands device for just notification feels a little bit wrong i think for something like a todo list notification should not be a premium feature there is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and i have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite it is so clean simple easy to use and it does recurring todos
4,the date search doesnt work in chinese it understand chinese date in a wrong way
4,pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added i dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me
4,хорошее приложение есть подзадачи а время и дату напоминалке можно указывать текстом например завтра в 20
4,the newest version is great love the new boards feature
4,i dislike that i must pay to use comments and i dislike that there is no way to add a description to the task i understand that in regards to the former that you need to make money but the latter issue makes it clunky if one has a long and complicated task with resources one must past links to in but i do appreciate the app and am impressed with how consistently you stay on top of squashing bugs keep it up cant wait to see kanban implemented
4,why editing task is so difficult intuitively i long press to edit but no response then i have to figure out here and there to find how to edit
4,pretty good so far
4,the automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes it would also be nice to have a maps integration  i do not think it is there
4,its good but not perfect because i have same tasks everyday and the tasks i kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason i am switching to ticktick
4,good if u are a to do list person
4,almost perfect with a lot on my mind and a million projects up in the air todoist does almost everything i need it to do its the best option out there so far but i wish i could use it as my only to do app would need the ability to not have completed tasks move to the bottom of their section but stay in their original order have new tasks appear at the top of the inbox list toggle to swipeonly to complete accidental checking  see a percent complete number or visual for projsect
4,okey
4,simple helpful and very neat
4,its lived up to what it say it would do
4,free version has some limitations but great productivity app so farlongest ive kept one going on the phone yet
4,i think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect i find myself constantly going back and forth between todoist and google calendar to schedule my stuff all in all a great app though
4,its better to put more options for notifications actually the best notifiaction options is for samsung reminder
4,it would be great if you can set an estimated time for every activity but its great
4,make it easier to learn how to use it
4,i like it but i do wish they could have alarms or reminders or something
4,making a list is not something i find easy but todoist is making it happen
4,best app ever but we cant resort task from widget  plz add this feature tnx alot
4,task sections with a  in their name get converted to _ almost perfect a feature id love is if using share could predict the project youre adding to based on the app youre sharing from when i share from spotify youtube or soundcloud it always goes to my music project i wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that i like to add these links to my music protect and preselect it for me
4,works great
4,amazing app definitely my to do app of choice wish it had a more robust calander view with a proper week view function its also increasingly hard to justify the premium when free equivalents are getting so much better googles apple microsofts and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists notion a big gripe for me is that its design  ui is falling a little behind its competitors things 3 apple reminders which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app
4,pretty cool app the best for to list or management ive ever used
4,better than all the other dozen other similar apps ive tried
4,good list app simple to use
4,so far good need to check for addons
4,its the best in my opinion but i feel tasks should not just be overdue i think introducing an option to indicate that you didnt do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks
4,it was a gud experience and i found it useful to plan my exam schedule priorities
4,enjoying offloading from my head and the app telling me what ive scheduled from the day great for busy minds
4,not perfect but so far my favorite to do app
4,keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project this app will definitely help you in all the ways it can great for increasing productivity
4,pretty cool like a lot has helped me very much
4,this app is great and has the potential to be greater however my only 2 requests is when you add a parent project to your favorites please include the projects within it as well and to also make setting alarms to your tasks more simple and reliable thanks
4,i appreciate the reminders
4,great app well organized and user friendly ui although monthly subscription is a bit much id rather pay full price for the whole app and get all the features it offers
4,found usefull
4,id like to see a list of the tasks ive done in the last 30 days
4,add pomodoro timer
4,why cant i see completed tasks in any project sometimes the program shows them sometimes doesnt
4,well designed app just wish it had some more flexibility for assigning dates and responsibilities i also havent been very successful at using the notification function
4,great but could use more assistance features to help automate your task management
4,helps me reminder the important tasks to do
4,i am still testing it efficiency
4,awesome to do and project management would revommend also i hope to get the premium soon
4,420420 amazing app that beats my lame ass planner
4,a really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it
4,enjoying the app but cant figure out how to get it on my galaxy active 2 watch whenever i try to find the app for it i get directed to the phone app
4,reminder is a paid feature and the premium version is too costly
4,free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done
4,so far this app has been very helpful i will be trying out the premium version very soon once i do i will update this review
4,easy to program not bad at all
4,the handling is very fast and intuitive
4,enjoying it so far i just cant seem to sync it with my calendar so i get no notifications for my todo list and i need to open the app to check i need to do
4,nice app to keep me focused
4,so helpful tool
4,its fantastic but i took a star off because they nagged me to rate it
4,eu gosto muito do aplicativo a minha sugestão seria para ter a opção de não excluir as tarefas concluídas porque psicologicamente falando dá uma satisfação chegar ao fim do dia e ver todas as tarefas que foram feitas com um risquinho 
4,unfortunatelly you must to pay for reminders 
4,i really like this app the way things are organized and how simple it is what i dont like is that the completed tasks automatically disappear and each time i wanna see them i have to click on the option to show them i wish there was a function were you can choose as default if the completed entries are hidden or not
4,im loving this app i would have given 5 stars but the only thing i didnt like is that it doesnt have any reminder you have to buy it anyway overall the app is impressive you can go for it
4,i want to make a note buy present for april but it always converts to buy present due april 1st i have tried april instead of april but it also doesnt work edit april works its the most elegant solution i can find i cant find a way to just type text if there would be and easy to understand way id give 5 stars
4,found that on the phone app the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited 100 or 200 but on the computer version there is no such limitation other than that its a good app
4,ll
4,as advertised very well organize i dont use it as much as my boss but he loves it im sure i have much more future use for it
4,functional and serves all needs for to do lists will happily give 5 when integration for alexa custom lists is implemented
4,straight forward
4,good but a little overwhelming
4,best task manager on the market the only weak points are subtask handling and sorting on some views but otherwise fantastic queries fast entry etc second to none
4,switched to todoist from microsoft todo and it has all the features from that and more i wish that push notifications werent a premiumonly feature as this was something todo provided for free nevertheless this is probably the best todo list app ive used
4,very nice app easy to use
4,for now am on love the the app is very very efficient
4,very good but dont see why 1 would pay when google has google keep  and calendar works about the same and is free
4,fantastic app to get it together still lacking a few features eg creating lists
4,great app keeps up to date
4,this is a useful tool
4,missing back buttons on some screens otherwise great
4,very well done for improving your task management only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review
4,so far so good wish i could see what was done on any given day an option to show tasks with a completion indicator strike through would be helpful also would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as i sometimes dont get to mark them on the same day
4,this is a really good app the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do
4,always a good thing great wonderful
4,overall its a great app i just wish i could link it with my google calendar or that it worked better with google assistant
4,i would like to have a widget on my homescreen but i have to pay however its really good for organize the tasks
4,doesnt link with my calendar or emails
4,ive been switching between task apps for years this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive quite a few features are paid for though and although i would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee a monthly fee isnt a commitment id be willing to make
4,gd
4,its a great organizational tool
4,very easy to use and really clear the only thing i miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks besides that its been a great app that helped my productivity
4,limits lists to 200 items that was old its better now
4,this was a solid replacement for wunderlist but it isnt simply a to do list its more of productive tasks
4,great app easy to use
4,great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version previously i gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app
4,great for use
4,makes me productive because im always up to a schedule
4,easy to navigate in order to keep track of tasks
4,great app are you going to add the ability to attach images to actions
4,its good
4,does what it needs to do very good integration with google calendar the time of a task in google calendar is standard set to one houre id prefer being able to change the amount of time i estimate to work on a task not being able to send emails as a task from different gmail accounts is a feature i miss but overall very good app hence 4 stars
4,fun and simple to use
4,just using the free version and use inbox for just a list of things to do
4,pros intuitive design great way to acheive goals cons not entirely free it works with google calendar but each task only can be in 1 hr intervals
4,wouldve been 5 stars if i am able to move around the arrangements of my tasks
4,best for schedule
4,it helps me think through all the elements needed to truly cross something off my list
4,had this app during college and it great to quickly add in things to do and also to have schedule projects very clean and easy to use
4,this is a great todo list app however the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here this app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app right now in the free version you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets but a reminder should be there even in the basic version
4,very simple todo list app simple but quite powerful even on the free plan there are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free but they are clunky to use the only problem i have is inability to hide things that are only available with the premium subscription such as labels and filters tabs but i understand why theyre there
4,am excellent replacement for toodledo still a little rough around the edges but being actively improved
4,really help me to manage my day 
4,easy to use very stable and works well with gtd methodology
4,does its job
4,helps to concentrate 
4,easy to use and packed with features
4,realmente es una muy buena aplicación es fácil ubicarte y organizarte si ya sabes usar este tipo de apps lo que encuentro mal es que hay opciones básicas como añadir notas a las tareas que están escritas y por ellas hay que pagar me gustaría que no hubieran tantas opciones de pago o por lo menos no tan esenciales de resto está muy bien esta aplicación
4,good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them it is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views i cant drag tasks up and down a list or cant see them ordered by subject edit follows to respond to todoists reply thanks for replying yes as you say sorting in filtered views is not possible or to use nondeveloper language ugghhh why cant i sort this list by project or in another way that suits me this is the one thing that i dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app wunderlist had better sorting and tick tick has it i would love to see this change in todoist
4,excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment reminder etc are locked on free edition
4,it could be much better if i could see my done tasks and not destroying them
4,easy and practical 
4,it is a really helpful app thank you developers id give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than overdue  maybe something more interactive click here or colorful
4,great overall app to get yourself organized
4,32780 weather 666iu778 is a kitten 27gh with q many different 87878how 1
4,so good so far i give 4 stars just because i didnt use all features yet so need to go back again to that raiting
4,great so far after a few days free trial
4,great app does things easily maybe a video of effective usage would help
4,this is the best why i give this 4 star because you need to be in premium to use the alarm thing
4,i think its a great app although i do have one suggestion after completing a task especially for the day maybe it would be more motivating to cross it out and keep it there so that one could see how many tasks they have completed till then and how much they have left
4,great for getting reminded of your tasks
4,good app that reminds me of my daily tasks
4,the free version is a bit too limeted however it does worth it
4,only wish missed dailys wouldnt count for the current day too otherwise brilliant
4,feature request i hope i can manually reorder tasks in label views like its done in project views of course to be synchronized across all platforms this will be cool
4,great organizer however too many features require you to have a paid membership while similar apps dont require any membership fees
4,love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now i do not get reminder for anything on time
4,it helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently 
4,its okay easy to use just wish incould add a topicnote header toneach individual note
4,wish the free version had more features
4,some issues with sync but so far i am enjoying it
4,great app wish navigating projects on mobile was easier
4,mostly great i just wish i could make my main to do list my home page
4,i have had a wonderful experience with this app it has genuinely helped me keep track of things i need to do it has help me gain structure in my life and i am really grateful for it this is from a guy who doesnt even bother to use google agenda lol great app good stuff and i hope they keep improving
4,right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working
4,wish i could add pictures to tasks but thats about it for the negative great app would highly recommend
4,so far so goodim seeing if its worth paying forive tried sooo many organizational apps
4,easy to use no dramas very streamline for basic list use
4,works great except reordering shared projects always fails my shopping project my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project but no problems on other projects
4,very simple and easy to use
4,great for groceries and remembering longterm todos
4,it is great
4,just getting started on it
4,overall good i just wish the alarm feature was available for the free download
4,appreciate this app it gives me a convenient way to list tasks on the fly
4,nice interface good help good configurability integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though
4,nice if youre bad at remembering everything you have to do quick and convenient
4,loving it
4,easy to use
4,good application it keep me focused on my goals one downside is whenever i put a new task on a specific day it doesnt areange it automatically i have to do this manually
4,is it possible to implement statistics on completing repetitive tasks
4,this is a great tool with a minimalist design one feature i would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget that would take this to the next level
4,easy to use wish printing lists so they fit on one or 2 pages was possible
5,this app is awesome i have a sugestion in the app cant see the projects order by folder will be good can see by folder
5,this app is such high quality in its usage and visual design its on par with the quality youd expect from google
5,its revolutionised the way i work as a medical student makes going from one task to another effortless allows me to stick to breaks etc
5,awesome app i am enjoying its simplicity and effectiveness
5,simply brilliant they put a lot of effort into a quick and smooth user interface keyboard shortcuts keywords date detection that allow me to implement gtd almost   at the speed of my thoughts keep up the excellent work
5,this app is one of the coolest app
5,one of the best todo apps out there started using it as a personal reminder list but the more i learned about the app the more conveniently it weaved itself into my life now it is an important part of my workflow
5,exceptional tool to boost ones productivity thanks for this amazing app
5,been using this app for a couple of years and overall its been solid its not only a lifesaver but it also provides a clean minimalistic aesthetic and intuitive options throughout the entire app high quality developments seems only natural to have bugs here and there or else theyd never be able to improve the apps functionality and innovate as a result attentive helpful customer support team devs and they provide guidestemplates and very helpful tips on their site keep it going 
5,2020 update 4 years later i have upgraded to a premium version especially after all the newly added features ive tried many other listreminder type apps and todoist stays my favorite 1st review in 2016 im still getting familiar with the app after a week but it seems to be very easy to use simple adding items categorizing them im using the free version

5,superb
5,the bugs been fixed so i wanted to update the review todoist is a really great app its slick its easy to pick up  use and its been essential to me in my day to day life the date and time input for tasks is super intuitive ev 10 daysev 1st  16th of the mth etc and i appreciate how easy it is to have tasks loop even with weird intervals the free version has pretty much everything the average user needs but im sure the features of the paid version will b well worth the price

5,great for basic lists to project management
5,i love the app
5,second update sep 2020 a solid choice  have been using todoist for about 5 years they are like a very slow  in terms of releasing features that you love and hate at the same time but at the end of the day this is a super powerful tool that has passed the test of time highly recommend
5,amazing tool to organize your day

5,phenomenal
5,this app is making me manage better i love it specially when i use it on different platforms and web i definitely suggest it to my friends
5,i like the app so far good game changer
5,cool app
5,honestly the best app i could ask for managing and completing tasks in a form of projects
1,greedy appnot worth the cost atleast can make it a one time purchase you can install google calendar tasks habit tracker seperately for free and still use it
1,wanted to try it out but the features i wanted pomo monthly calendar view etc are only available with a subscription wish i discovered that before syncing google calendar info
1,used to be a good app now its all buggy
1,pointless to have an account if you cannot have a task that lasts two days without paying for premium pomodoro is also premium
1,crashes my phone everytime a notification pops up to ask if i did a task shame because i like feature of building a habit but they cant even get this one feature right this is just a guess but i believe its because of the second popup after you hit yes to rate your mood pretty useless additional feature
1,not advisable and reliable highly complicated
1,love ticktick but the lag on the latest version of the mobile app is unbearable
1,i paid so muchcan you remove the subtaskis annoyinglagginghangnot the best anymoreextremely dissapointedworse and worsepleasepleasedo a new update
1,i paid for this yesterday and i got my premium only for one day today im not premium again i had enough disappointment because my 2nd device didnt get premium after i paid and now my first device also like this i emailed you since yesterday and also write on feedback on app but i got no reply
1,warning  steals data routes info to chinese servers before uploading to your cloud account check via nrf or pocket ssl capture app the good simplistic ui one may or may not like this the bad google authentication is buggy had to it thrice the ugly doesnt allow one to exportimport data
1,for a higher rating pls dont force a response after a long hard day also need more flexibility or instructions in opening closing deleting ending ie managing tasks
1,i paid for two account on two different device but at second device my premium membership cant be used i paid twice but i only get one premium account
1,i am a premium subscriber for 2 months i billed for october but my premium expired and app support is not replying to my emails
1,so much features require to pay to use evil money hungry developer
1,often freezing and crashing when i wanna add photos to task help or give my my money back  no support response tasks in calendar easy prioritization only usefull app in shop
1,if youre trying to build schedule its a pain on ticktick choose another app recurring tasks all move together when postponing one task when editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if youre doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking  when creating a recurring task i should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day
1,how do you sync this is next to worthless unless you can sync
1,i used to love ticktick for the combination of to do list and time tracking features i upgraded to the yearly premium service a couple of months ago about a week ago the app started crashing and now wont open at all i have tried uninstallingreinstalling a couple of times with not change i contacted ticktick through the app and by email and have gotten no response i use my to do list for everything and cant have service issues like this will not be renewing looking for a replacement
1,i dont get a completion sound when i finish a pomodoro
1,decent amount of functions and i really like the widget for this app but the free version is too limited to be useful i would pay money for this app if it was for sale but i am never going to pay for a subscription to a phone app especially not a todo list app
1,i love this app but the sync stoped working if i write list items on my phone oneplus 6  android 10 and after i open my desktop win10 client than my phone sync to my pc this leads that all my notes dissapire i am coming from google notes there the sync is nearly instantly back and forth i love to see this core function to be fixed as many others noted earlier i also locked the app in the backgound tasks and reinstalled no succes for me i will give 5 if this problem is solved
1,need the calendar view but im not paying ongoing fees for it not enough tasks in the free version account deleted shame
1,this was a great app but keep making changes that make it worse for example you used to be able to merge two tasks together but now doing so just makes one task a subtask of the other it doesnt actually merge them into one task and there doesnt seem to be a way around it edit  also if you edit tasks on the web version which is a quicker way of working around some of the apps flaws it doesnt seem to synchronize with the android app i now have a real mess of old and new tasks
1,i wasted 1390 hard earned money microsoft to do is far better
1,30 bucks per year yall have lost your minds uninstalled
1,this app never gets better no matter how i wait for improvements one is it late notifications of your to do list now its always frozen kindof dead or something it great app but im not using this again
1,i used to love ticktick i have it on mobile android and windows 10 client they used to sync beautifully around 23 aug the desktop client and mobile stopped syncing and acted like two separate accounts in desperation i reinstalled desktop client i couldnt log into client nor thru browser it complained of network configuration and proxies i dont use proxies i can log into any account online except ticktick the help rep is unresponsive super disappointed im on premium i want refund
1,installed this app added the tasks logged in using google in the same order but after login the tasks added no more found this is definitely unacceptable
1,concept is ok but i dont like ui it make me think a lot maybe the design is very clean
1,did not do what it said that it was going to do
1,i couldnt use this app cause payment method isnt available it would be great if you add some more payment options like bkash
1,useless without a paid subscription not even a weekly view is possible
1,many of options are in upgrade mode so i couldnt use them
1,the features of the app is pretty simple and cute so when it comes to the design its okay but thats not the purpose of the app its a reminder and it never worked oh it does at the first and last time  and it never works again the storage of my phone had been wasted 
1,when i try to complete my habits or swipe them away in the notification center my entire phone freezes up for a few seconds other than that its perfect
1,i wanted an app for easily sharing grocery shopping lists with my partner i shared the list with her nothing came through and the app told me to upgrade to premium no thanks  will pass
1,the tasks dont show when i go to a particular date such as the next day it says you have a free day even though all my tasks are set to daily what is the difference between daily and every day anyway i would also appreciate if the subtasks completely checked off once completed instead of showing the next date unlike the other tasks in the list i thought that id found the app with all the features i need and was considering to go premium but this has really frustrated me
1,was great till they added fermium garbage limits and way overpriced premium with crazy overkill features got to love the apology to a review its amazing how far companies will go to not make a sale or a dime  i happily pay for services to store data or provide entertainment and apps that provide tools but wow you must have some super users to garner 30yr in value from a task app id have been happy with ads or paying 10 once to get some small set of advanced features but damn
1,complicated mess
1,to view your calendar you have to sign up  then after you sign up it say you have to upgrade  by upgrade they mean buy it for a month subscription or pay for a year  cant really use it for its intended purpose without having to buy it i downloaded it because i was under the assumption that its basic functioning was free the subscription price is cheap but im careful which places i put my bankcard info as i dont feel comfortable putting any info about myself out there
1,lost all my gnotes information with no advanced warning years of important information all disappeared now call tick tick with no integration very poor and has caused huge problems
1,for task duration you need premium
1,syncing in the background between android and mac hasnt worked for multiple months have to manually go into the android app and do a sync doing a background sync on android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice stop adding features and fix this already
1,terrible support i purchased the yearly suscription and i got no answer using the feedback  suggestion from the app and neither using mail to get a refund scam
1,چطوری باید باهاش کار کنیم
1,i loved this app i used it every day but suddenly it wont share attachments i get emails with pdf documents attached and i used to open the pdf and share it with tick tick and the app would be so awesome it would create a new todo with the pdf attached to it now not only does the app look different which is fine but i can no longer share the pdf files from my email to the app that was the whole point of using it for me im really unhappy i also sent feedback through the app
1,when will gant view come
1,fewer integration with google account
1,app cannot sync in backround so it does not sync with your tasks created for example on your pc until you open it manually sync it very annoying feature and also making your tasks ureliable too bad because otherwise its perfect ps i already has contacted the support they sent me automatic reply and nothing has happened since
1,app is good however customer support is not that much i have contacted them 3 times about an issue and the request is being ignored i am really sorry that i have to give a low evaluation in order to finally get the attention of the customer support i am a paying customer for 3 years now
1,asks me to upgrade just to be able to connect to google task calendar uninstall
1,provided apk installed looks a bit better but still has some delay after click on complete from push notification upd4 no tasks duplication anymore delay between click on complete and task movement to completed tasks list still occurs same delay happens when i mark task checkbox fron the tasks list not only from push when i snooze task no such delay at all upd5 app hangs on switch betw tomorrow and today i have not enough spaces to describe cases there may you share issue tracker
1,so bad i wish it blocked
1,has failed to sound and show tasks at the right time or at all yet still put the recurrence on for the day after i have a reminder set for every two weeks but it went off after only one week so i took my medication too early fortunately no harm done to me uninstalled
1,it was on my phone when i bought it i have no interest in a trash app like this
1,my experience is the exact same as theodores review below constant syncing problems with google making the app completely unusable started happening around the same date as well around july 25 2020 i emailed the support team with a description and screen shots of the problem and still havent received a reply ticktick used to be a great app but has progressively gotten worse and now unusable thats okay though ive had to switch back to todoist because of these issues
1,cant import without signing up i dont want to give up privacy
1,38year yall out your damn minds cant even view a full month calendar with the free version only day and week silly devs
1,worst app for reminder period use google products instead they will work no matter if you turn on or off the background use this power hungry good for nothing apps are straight to be ruled out well if you dont believe me give it a try and keep regretting
1,absolutely refuses to not sync data with google account if i try to use a gmail sign in i have to sync everything with google the app will ask 500 times in a row regardless of how many times i hit deny makes the entire app totally unusable changing emails is a massive pain in the ass if you already have a google account associated with it this is absolute garbage
1,i think this is just irritating because i just planned my whole day and kept reminders not even a single reminder came through the whole 24 hours
1,poor practically no functionality available in free version even day view is restricted removing this app from my phone
1,dont trust this no uninstall information anywhere makes it feel scammy
1,update  the app is from hong kong and after the recent chinese law i urge anyone to stop using it  i use to love the app rated it 5 stars previously but sadly nothing can be done 
1,the in app calendar view doesnt show the tasks ive scheduled when the devs responded to my 1st play store review i thought theyre going to fix it but now even after several updates its clear they had not taken my feedback with much seriousness uninstalling
1,price not shown before creating an account
1,the tasks doesnt show up on time and it always overdue and i dont get to finish my important tasks i have to find another one  to do list app this app sucks
1,further to my previous comment it looks like app is hanging on syncing as same behaviour can be duplicated multiple times first started happening on 7th july p20 pro andriod 10
1,270 per month for a to do list app are you serious i would mind an add banner at all and would find it fare i know you guys arent volunteers but guys dont think that i am as desperate enough as to pay such a fee for to do lists
1,recent update broke sync battery drain and constant crashing sort the basics before adding fancy features
1,chinese app
1,i set a reminder since last week it didnt even ring at the chime of the clock while i observed it rang post 10min approx that too when i accessed the app to see whats the fault please look into this bug
1,its china app so dont use it if you love your privacy
1,at first oke unless you dont want to give permission to google each time you deny to share youre data the question simply pops up 10 more times hoping you click allow this is pesky
1,too many errors
1,the premium version of the app is goodbut the free version is useless and some school students dont get proper support paying monthly from their family of my country every interesting and useful feature arw in premium
1,subscription based calendar immediately uninstall it
1,worst customer care they cant manage a refund im very disappointed scam
1,i bought the full version of gtasks pro from this company and now its unavailable think twice before buying from them
1,i dont like this app becauseno protecting from this app
1,reminders doesnt work
1,i dont like this app
1,automatic synchronisation disabled by developers 
1,keeps asking for a rating ok heres one
1,i found ticktick not satisfy me failed to give me alarm on events for a week long testing 
1,guys this is chinese origin copy of wunderlist app which is free of cost  here they charge claiming for premium features not worth
1,do not work on time
1,this is a bad app after purchasing a paid subscription i got a lot of ads instead of an app that helps me plan my businessi hardly see the task scheduler just advertising a lot of advertising the authors are too greedy
1,its chinese so fear of data security issues uninstalled it
1,they double billed me for my premium subscription and wont respond to any refund requests i have been a premium subscriber for over a year and changed my payment method from paypal to google play subscription but ended up being billed twice at my renewal once through each method ive reached out to their support email address 4 times and havent even gotten a response this app is a good app but you cannot trust them with your financial information or expect them to respond to you if you have a problem
1,this is the beat app of all 
1,i downloaded this app after hearing good things about it i had todoist and my subscription ended and i wanted to try this i downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist after entering everything i uninstallled todoist bad idea i decided to upgrade ticktick to premium once i upgraded they asked me to sign in which i did upon signing in it deleted all the items i had in the app already contacted support havent heard back from then yet what a way to thank me for upgrading
1,it just vibrate i never get an alert it only list the task and vibrate when i open the app it doesnt alert me
1,problem with login
1,annoys user to rate the app heres your one star
1,i cant sign in to my account
1,you cannot delete the account from application for some unknown reason
1,unable to login in all login options it says sign in failed check nw but nw is fineam able to access internet
1,the app is really clumsy to use i took the paid version of this app but still it feels like that the app cant help you with anything its better to set a reminder of your own money waste
1,boycott chinese products shame on chinese president
1,its been a good app but i cant sign in now i cant even renew my premium membership i love this app but its been like this for long you will always be redirected to the sign in page everytime you sign in
1,waste of time
1,very bad app
1,i purchsed this specifically for the pomodoro feature among other features its not included in the app
1,in pomo mode white noise option gone or not easily found at least to me tried web search with no help only silent or ticking clock option seen which is annoying cannot email customer service url outdated through web link
1,the majority of things are blocked off by subscription
1,when i try to set up avatar  photo on oneplus 6  i have black screen
1,awful support unable to move reoccuring tasks before completing previous one look up the definition of planning again
1,i didnt like it premium for month view really 
1,does not work reminders do not show up
1,useless after
1,the date and time parsing is broken it doesnt recognize  set up meeting for xxxxx at 9am tomorrow  it throws an error saying its past due and sets up at 9 am today  can you fix this
1,earlier this app was working fine but now frequently missing to remind task on set time
1,connects unasked with fb
1,would be great if they would stop interrupting workflow to beg for reviews update still begging also isnt it a violation of googles tos to specifically ask for a 5 star review i thought you could ask for a review but not tell people what rating to give
1,this app doesnt work the way we wont it doesnt notify after even permitting it
1,whole other to do list apps provide muce more for a normal user for free you are just greedy minded pushing everything to be paid
1,it wont let me remove my subscription
1,unable to subscribe i am from india i think this might be the reason whenever i click on pay it shows unavailable for this purchase i have tried using different debitcredits cards still same issue if i open in desktop i can pay using paypal but while converting dollar to rupees it shows more money than it shows me in android app for subscription price also i feel 1300 bucks for this is a bit pricy but seeing american economy and price in dollars it may be cheap but here costly
1,did you delete my previous comment ok one of the reason todoist is better than ticktick is i cant register my email which is an active and also my primary email been few days but i still dont get the verification email yet ask me to change email instead so thats 1 of many if you can help me on this i might consider to try it and give u more stars
1,bad and have ads
1,very good app but in widget there is a no option in list wise select today tomorrow or all please update for this option then it will be far better please update example if theres a call list in widget it shows in call widget list all call today tomorrow other all day but it should option to select today tomorrow etc
1,its not good app because its not accurate like i set 915am when the time reach that time it didnt get notification to me after 915 like 917182025 like that
1,its not a good app i dont recommend it everything you have to pay for 
1,ive used this app for years on several models of galaxy phones very unreliable for reminders it even has a built in notification that pops up saying reminders not working do this but the instructions make no sense and dont match the menus of my phone uninstalling now
1,the application looks nice and simple but the synchronization between mobile and desktop version is awful a lot of pictures from tasks which were added via desktop version are not accessible on mobile and vise versa
1,some of the crucial features are premium only
1,worst experience ever i signed out  all of my tasks list gone login bar doesnt even showing what email it was and i dont remember my email i was going to buy this app but hate now dont have any way to backup my list
1,worst ever had
1,i can not change my font size
1,run from this horrible app i wasted three days trying to get it to work duplicates list when importing app charged me over 15000 worst customer service this is a terrible app does not work total rip off
1,just another app with a subscription based service
1,useful function require paid membership doesnt solve the purpose
1,it doesnt work 
1,i had previous mentioned a glitch in the wedgit its been 5 months and was told that a team was working on the glitch so far there has been no improvement its a good app without appropriate maintenance hence the bad review
1,this app is horrible it was working well at first but when i tried to edit my list titles and add more lists but it never worked no matter how many times i tried and trust me that was many many times this app is very annoying and over all very useless
1,i just want to make a checklist  couldnt figure out how
1,kept crashing rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was huge and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping im out update no i cant send a feedback with log as ive already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app and thats surely something you can add into functionality if youre really interested in gathering the data
1,want to know that is there any feature like wunderlist app to get notification of comment on all shared members on their app as well as on email
1,max of 9 lists then you pay 3 bucks a month
1,pesters me to rate it immediately one star
1,requires creating an online account to view the calendar therefore there is no reason to use this over google calendar
1,the free version is crippled 3 lists max seriously just use dtg gtd to do app with free unlimited nested todo lists with tags and reminders
1,very good app that is perfect for how i think but it kept asking me to rate the app for months now and ive always pushed later im sick of it asking me to rate the app
1,help the widgets are not working it always shows this message failed to display your tasks please restart app or add a new widget instead
1,nothing is free very bad
1,another app that fails to draw events correctly on day view if i have an event from 300 to 315 and another from 315 to 330 there should be drawn with a space between them no matter how much i am zoomed in they are not overlapping events so dont treat them like they are
1,while using the habbit feature you can add multiple reminders for drinking water but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day ruins the logic uninstalled installed a year later and still the issue exists the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but i guess ill have to use another one
1,update 2192020 i cant recommend this app to anyone the smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous i have many apps that push notifications on time and dont require that so the developers dont know how to do reminders correctly horrible app
1,downloaded ticktick thought it seemed cool so signed in with google account and tried to sign up for monthly subscription kept getting error messages and it wouldnt let me start the process or even add a card waste of time
1,just purchased monthly subscription until now my app is not working as a full version
1,one of the worst appif someone believes in this app for sure they are going to miss that appointment
1,sorry you have reached the use limit on subtasks upgrade now and add up to 199 subtasks per task are you serious guys pro version for more subtasks why 199 why not unlimited
1,free version only allows 9 lists lame
1,cant even understand how to use itdidnt like at all
1,cannot share entire calendar andor task database with other users only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations edit very solid low 1 star 0 if i could since the developer couldnt even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review acknowledging what features they did have
1,you block new entry on my existing list and force me to upgrade to premium if i wont to continue
1,no subtasks
1,only reviewing so the app stops asking me to do so even when i do review the app still asks me 3 stars to 1
1,i keep adding tasks its nit showing on widget very complicated to use
1,not good app all u need buy and clock facility not given
1,i have used this app for years but there is now a major issue if you drag a task to tomorrow or place it under a task with a later date the task date no longer changes date is there any way to revert to an earlier revision hi i have sent screenshots but the issue is the same
1,for years i use ticktick i love it so much i rated it 5 in play store but the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before i incredibly sad and disappointed for years i rely on ticktick as my todolist app and now i have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that i know before thats not an easy thing to do
1,you need to pay its uselles without paying seriously just 9 list for free if you need more list just add them in wunderlist and then import them to this app or better stick with todo from microsoft its free
1,it keeps showing javalangruntimeexception unable to start receiver comtickticktaskactivitywidgetappwidgetscrollable javalangnullpointerexception attempt to invoke virtual method boolean javalangbooleanbooleanvalue on a null object reference at androidappactivitythreadhandlereceiveractivitythreadjava3421 at androidappactivitythreadaccess1300activitythreadjava200 at androidappactivitythreadhhandlemessageactivitythreadjava1684 at androidoshandlerdis
1,only 9 lists allowed for the free edition incredibly expensive by app standards for the pro 37 per year i dont mind supporting a good product but that is ridiculous for a shopping and task list app
1,very expensive premium
1,apps that cost should be required to disclose how much these cost up front so people can decide if they even want to download it we shouldnt have to hunt for the cost
1,cant assign to multiple people verry bad 
1,i have been a big fan of todoist for years i tried this last week and the themes are awful 
1,very annoyed by the new time setting its like going back to android 21
1,the reminders do not work
1,why do i need to pay for basic features such as showing your tasks in month view its a calendar app those are stuff you need to see cant believe you need to pay premium for a calendar todo app to show your freaking todos in the calendar
1,widget has stopped working and the developer is unresponsive
1,seriously just realised you made duration a premium feature why did people just start using it more all of a sudden
1,new update has performance bug very slow in scrolling down and typing update after last update now i cannot type or write anything in task description after markdown features 
1,i cant no longer recommend this  cant sign up on any platform and they servers are located in asia i wouldnt put any sensitive information on it they have nothing but server issues  its very fischy
1,update noticed this app sending data to facebook when i set up my firewall no bueno
1,worst app i qm trying to create acount with gmail but it say no internet connection even my internet work fine every thing working nicely even you tube without lagging
1,doesnt allow you to unsubscribe from premium and the developers dont even respond whether on email or twitter
1,its impossible to use this app at first when i choosed pink theme during onboarding the app ignored my choice then i filled it with all my tasks for two days but when i closed it and opened again the app asked me to sign up with google all my tasks were gone when i did it im deeply disappointed
1,deleted my account because i found something more aligned to my needs but i still got charged for another year developer ignored my email and then denied a refund via paypal so ive now paid 28 for something i cant and no longer want to use had no issues with the app itself but very disappointed with the customer service
1,cancer notifications i denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound now it is impossible to change or mute the sound no matter what setting i change inside or outside the app and whether or not i give the app the permissions it wanted 4 stars when this is fixed
1,markdown causes laggy typing in description and it seems i cant disable it
1,want upgraded version even to set the duration  pathetic app
1,was good but has recently been persistently bugging me for addl permissions including to my google account uninstalled it
1,um you need to pay for the duration of the task no thanks i will just find a new app
1,horrible now was good to start but now that my subscription expires december 1 cannot even accomplish a simple thing like removing tags from task names very disappointed
1,i dont understand why the app has all the languages except the arabic language
1,no reply to my ticktick premium cancellation mail since 2 days  new update another day has passed and no reply to mail has been received yet
1,wastage of time
1,no pomo time more than 1hr no whitelist available no feature for tracking task progress also add the feature to quit bad habits
2,tried my level best reminder ringtone is not working
2,guys need remind alarms i need sound message is not enough not for subtasks for tasks they havent sound only notification if you can help me solve my problem i am buy premium
2,not very helpful
2,not good looking and hard to manage tasks
2,i gave up trying to learn how to use this app its not intuitive i can always find a ton of options except the one im always looking for plus once i figure something out i cant remember how to repeat what i did after a couple days today i downloaded a different app and so far its a lot more intuitive
2,not user friendly so many useless functions  complex to use
2,i absolutely adored this app until the most recent update the task nesting feature is far too sensitive and becoming a real nuisance i emailed the developers about this issue a week ago and sadly received no response ill be cancelling my subscription until this issue is rectified
2,thought this might be a good alternative to microsoft todo but most of the features are locked behind a subscription
2,please fix the new sub category feature i am a paid yearly subscriber i love this app and i loved being able to drag items item or arrange their listing but recently my tasks either just get lost to oblivion duplicate themselves for some reason or when i try to rearrange tasks by dragging them higher or lower so its more organized it will just end up becoming a sub category to a different task then i have to take out time to figure what happened to the task where it went  fixing everyt
2,features are really awesome but the app takes forever to open by the time it opens up i have already lost the task to be written i opted out of premium after getting so tired of the app freezing on my phone and on the web again the app has really good features but the performance issue is a killer because the whole point of a productivity app like this is to get things done would give it a 5 star when this gets fixed please look into it and solve this churn problem to get your users back
2,some tasks do not stay saved on the day i completed them so i cant keep of track them i have the show completed option on
2,it is very great app but the sync feature is terrible i have to manually sync every time sometimes the notification doesnt fire 12 hours later because i created a task on the computer and it didnt sync in background to my phone thats useless then
2,widget sering tidak muncul kegiatan hari ini dan harus tutup buka baru muncul
2,افتضاحه و حال به هم زن ترین برنامه ای است که تا حالا دیدم
2,promising but not up to the mark list order changes randomly many bugs user experience is poor microsoft to do or todoist has better user interface and experience
2,why can i not select calendar anymore when making smart lists
2,i love this apps design however the fact the monthly calendar is only available for premium users is very disappointing
2,my phone freezes up everytime i complete or snooze tasks whether it be through the popups or just through the app itself edit after the last update nothing has changed and in fact this issue has gotten worse as i slowly build up my number of tasks every night i tend to reset a lot of reminders for the next day and now my phone almost always freezes up for a good 2 minutes and then hits me with a close system ui which then turns off my phone for some more time 2 stars now instead of 3
2,major bug in the latest versions when pressing backspace in an empty check item the cursor moves to the above item but it deletes one character at the end of the task title
2,made promo worse theres no count down just has 3000 and when i exit the app the time color ring resets its self is this a bug
2,i like the features of this app and it was working quite well but the last few weeks it does not play the notification sound it triggers and i see the notification but no sound this is really not good ill have to look for another app
2,the alarm is delayed  its not working anymore
2,really clean and seems to have a lot of good features but i got this app specifically to make grocery shopping lists to share with my husband i have sent him the collaboration invite multiple times and the list has not appeared in his app the collab feature goes not appear to work
2,app is great for making lists and adding details etc but reminders simply do not work ive adjusted the app settings to allow reminders but they never show up if they worked i would have rated it higher
2,was working great and i use it across desktop android and iphone for last few weeks though it does not sync will not update to iohone and freezes repeatedly on android so as to make it unuseable freezes when sel3cting or adding items can maybe make one change now before it freezes every time will be looking for a replacement app to use
2,the app is great i paied for premium account and transaction done but my account still basic and saying failed to verify even google play confirmed the payment i email the contact email with no response
2,new update causing app to freeze pls correct it immediately
2,im sure the premium might be fine but all of the most important features are locked behind a paywall i wanted a simple app that would let me set repeated reminders on my phone but this surely isnt it at first it told me i just needed to sign up to do that so i did but then it said i needed premium very misleading i immediately uninstalled because that is just untrustworthy behaviour to me
2,i cant use it because i must to pay and be premium that rude 
2,the latest update has made my mobile sync completely nonexistent i even uninstalled cleared junk restarted my phone and reinstalled but that actually made it so much worse  the app now thinks im horribly behind on repeating tasks that i deleted months ago
2,no notification is showing nor any alarm i would have given a five but whats the benefit if the app is not working its main functionality i dont get any notification when the app is not running in recent apps
2,i think this app retarted my samsung tab s3 smt825y itself i had reset my tablets just to know what was my problem when i reinstall ticktick it started restart again like malware or something please fix
2,i cant say how much i loved this app before now theyre making it messier by badges  etc its a professional todo list app please leave it that way
2,loved it until the last update now the widgets dont show just a blank white block that says problemloading widget please fix
2,tick tock plaece
2,there is a limit to the attachments that can be madenot a substitute for wunderlist
2,cant attach photos says photo too large on android and on iphone it just fails
2,slows down my phone big time
2,ugly all white ui themes make almost no difference no option to keep completed tasks in list sync is unreliable and does not even notify the user when unsuccessful service is down right now per their twitter but app shows no errors sync simply doesnt work web ui is extremely bloated and runs an unacceptable amount of client side scripts still better than the new google tasks though
2,after the task time is over the app without giving the relax time shows that the relax time is over it usually happens alternate manner
2,do not like this app its confused me i certainly dont need help getting confused from an app i do well enough on my own
2,annoying terrible i keep going in circles when it tells me to sign in and when i want to schedule something the steps r confusing never again until they make it better
2,great task app but it will auto reformat your typing and you cant stop it  this is a huge problem
2,excelente jusquà lundi depuis seul les rappels fonctionnes à priori lappli ne fonctionne absolument plus
2,earlier this was a very good apps suit for me and my activities but after i installed it on my pc  change my password the apps on my phone keeps telling me to reset password from web even though i already did it  so now i cant use it on my phone coz every time i try to open the apps it always making my phone restart
2,ehnot great for an expensive app one of my important tasks went missing i asked for help but response hasnt produced the lost task yet
2,nur 9 listen erlaubt in kostenlose version
2,i really want to subscribe for premium but the purchase options are not available tried alternative option its showing unavailable
2,thought the ui was clunky and unintuitive i bought their premium based on an mkbhd video  i will be cancelling today
2,all basic features are paid and the free features are very limitedvery disappointing
2,i love this app and has great potential  however it seriously flawed with sync issues and as such i cannot rely on it for my appointments or task due dates  sometimes i create a task  then move it to another date time  when the sync happens the task disappeares from calendar and goes back to original date
2,if you keyword search there is no sort you end up with search results in random order which is basically worthless at least to me
2,not intuitive
2,my biggest problem is that theres no free trail and a lot of stuff is behind the pay wall but id like to try before i buy also as a first time user theres a few issues i downloaded it on my tablet and landscape mode doesnt work well for all pages especially the habit details page there was also no tutorial so i was left to just click around when i later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so im not sure why there isnt on my tablet
2,کامل نیست
2,im at awe how the tick tick guys keep managing to destroy a perfectly working app by having to redesign it every once in a while just for the sake of saying that theyre keeping the app running now i cant delete the messages because its almost barely visible once i push the three dots or lines on the tasks and there is no way to scroll the choices to see the delete option please for the love of gods dont work so hard to ruin a perfectly functioning software id love to ask just why
2,it wasnt enough good because lots of its features was unavailable
2,limit of 9 lists total are you kidding
2,devs tried to send me a link in the review comments which i cant even copy let alone open from my phone because their apps is too unintuitive to use without a manual
2,it was okay in the beginning but its shortcomings are becoming more glaring with use also recently the habits simply disappeared recently and the pop up for check in is annoying i paid for the premium and wont be renewing for a second
2,all my tasks have been moved half an hour forward very annoying
2,it was ok before now it changes the stuff that i enter please fix
2,the program is very good on my old phonegalaxy note 4 but notifications dont work on the new oneredmi note 8 pro i hope you will fix them thanks
2,برنامه ی خیلی خوبیه از همشون بهترهولی جا داره ک بهترم بشه
2,as a user of gtasks owned by ticktick how do i fully synchronise my data with the cloud preferably google but will make do with the ticktick servers i pay for this service but only 40 of my tasks are backed up on ticktick servercloud any and all advice much appreciated kind regards john collington
2,this has the beginnings of a great app but lots more work still needs to be done
2,very hard to use cannot get a list of task to do until do date
2,good but the paid version did not work as i wanted to use it more so i was disappointed
2,works well but free version only gives you three total lists
2,missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app
2,didnt like that to really use it as a planner i had to upgrade
2,having issues with syncing with google calendar i added a task on ticktick and its been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my google calendar ive tried refreshing but nothing showed up ive looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now i just purchased the pro and its not worth it if it doesnt sync
2,add a feature that lets me tick tasks off from the widget either than that i love the app
2,good bt nt what i was looking for
2,cant post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars disappointed because this app has promise
2,i found developers lie about free features i just turned into day view i asked to login and then i asked to upgrade in description this option and several other options mentioned as free
2,tasks that i change dates does not move to the new date assigned im dismayed because i am a premium member moreover it doesnt have a 1 week or 7 day folder apart from the calendar i also want to see a 7 day list or folder
2,cmon to have more than 10 lists ive to pay nope thats not gonna happen
2,i liked the app notifications when they worked gotta pay 299 a month crazymbe a year not a month for a calendar app most widget features wont work unless u pay never got to see if they even were worth 299 a monthi like the popup reminders hopefully someome will make a free one
2,widget is not working completely it does not sync with the app plz solve this problem
2,i dont know why they changed it but i hate the fact that you cant type in the time anymore you have to scroll like youre on wheel of fortune or something that is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented i dont mind it if theres a option but this doesnt appear to give you a choice anymore please change it back
2,from all possible options ive tried out this has most awkward and unintuitive interface
2,when u want to add check list this will help you out instead of writing some where u can add them out here but in the case u want to develop it as a habit then u have to changes the setting and activate habits mode even in that u can create only 5 habits if u want to create more than 5 habits u will be asked to update to premium version only 5 habits thats funny if its atleast 10 then okay
2,night mode doesnt show up under theme
2,had been very good but now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue on repeating tasks sometimes marking todays as done will also mark 1 2 or even 3 days into the future as done with no pattern behind the glitch has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed
2,quick add got fixed now the sync is broken
2,you asked me to pay premium version but instant google calendar sync still doesnt work needs few hours for tasks to sync this been an issue for years already and you ignore pleas from users on the other hand the gtasks app you have works really great
2,perfect app except for 12hour sync with google calendar
2,getting annoying reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later start looking for alternatives
2,i love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task this app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work its the reminders im neverrrrr of my tasks i never get the notifications i tried everything that was wriiten in the reminders not working but it still has not been fixed could u please look into it asap
2,loved ticktick  great interface and the widget was perfect unfortunately i had to move on to todoist ticktick doesnt have alexa capabilities and thats a deal breaker for a while ifttt and gmail provided a good workaround but recent changes to gmail rendered that functionality inoperable ticktick get on board with alexa and ill come back
2,reminder is not working in realme phone i did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working
2,after update i couldnt log in to my google account the button allow wasnt working after applying the workaround and setting an email in webversion my app on the phone requested permissions to my contacts i allowed it the popup in the app did not disappear after pressing ok several times it went away however now the app doesnt fetch the information from the cloud i wanted to buy pro not anymore you cant fix the bug with google account for several months now embarrassing
2,not backup in device offline 
2,i downloaded and paid for this app several days ago it has some good aspects but now i literally hate some other aspects of it for example if you set a specific time for a specific time eg 13 pm it disapears without giving you a chance to do anything with it so if you didnt finish that task you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else how ridiculous it is im really scared i cant trust this tool i have to switch to something else and cut my losses
2,please fix the widget it keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time
2,disappointing i have been happily using this application for years now but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed one example when you create an event thats further away than a month the app will at all times change the date and time to incorrect ones it has done this each time for me over the last months changing the dates and times for no reason you can imagine this is a dealbreaker for a planning app
2,3 a month to use most of the app na features are nice but disappointed i cant just buy the app
2,now when i get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification theres no way to change this edit reminder popups is already switch off
2,easy to use and understand i have an issue with the reminder settings if i set a time reminder then it drains my battery so i am not able to use this function otherwise i am happy
2,the free version is garbage compared to anydo every other click pops up premium warning and its annoying as hell
2,best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire they only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if i open any other app old standard android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until i dealt with it  far superior please bring that back
2,keep getting a pop up reauthorisation failed even though my google account is already authorised on my account
2,has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time this most recent update messed up notifications on android 10 they dont follow the system dark mode at all instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors it looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode it also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps if this isnt fixed soon ill be looking for a new reminder app
2,this is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me i found a free app that does tbe same things
2,i really like this app its one of the best reminder apps there is however the new custom notifications are horrible it sticks out like a sore thumb you have to manually set between white or black background which means that they dont automatically switch with android 10 dark mode theyre also not black but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications title and time also dont line up with other notifications plus it says a min ago which is only accurate if i look at my phone immediately and it turns on the screen when the notification comes in even if its in my pocket this is a great app but the recent update is one of those if it aint broken dont fix it moments i really hope you consider going back to standard android notifications or at least provide an option between custom or standard ill gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens
2,the new notifications are useless to me i always keep my phone on vibrate and the old normal android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too but now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss and ive tried changing the settings and nothing works i really dont understand why not use androids buildin notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off
2,i wouldve switched to ticktick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour 
2,a very good to do manager i would take a premium version if on the windows version it would possible to setchangemanage location reminders for this feature i already wait some years im really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app its annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in android again to add a location reminder but it seems to be to difficult for the programmers so when this is to difficult what can we expect will the maintanance of the windows app stay on a reliable basis waiting already since years for a change didnt know why the ask me to change settings on android to change place reminders on my windows ticktick may be i should give up 18102019
2,when i share my task on whatsapp even though i selected share title and content it only shares title version  522  if i share my task in the form of image the task with long name the end of the name gets replaced with  instead of showing the remaining heading on new line
2,in general i really like this app but every time it does an update or my phone restarts i have to go to redo the battery optimization settings because otherwise i dont receive notifications this is just ridiculous that it doesnt save my settings 3 months later and still have the same problem
2,loved this app until it stopped syncing my android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks
2,such a scam first it asks you to sign up for making duration related reminder once you sign up it says that you got pay money for that features  deleted this app at the next moment of seeing those scam stuffs
2,the interface is ok but ticktick does not sync with google tasks you can import google tasks but no tasks added in ticktick app will appear on google calendar if a task list doesnt integrate with google tasks if i am limited to using the standalone app and cannot see tasks on other devices  computers then the task mgmt app isnt really good for anything
2,i think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible i just paid for premium and the app will not sync during the trial the sync between android app and pc app was also very bad if they could get the connectionsync issues fixed it would be a great app if i cant access the premium features i paid for in the next few hours im going to be requesting a refund
2,all the main options are charged then why list the app for free might as well list it as charged app
2,useful but constantly calls out to access crashlytics facebook etc too much spyware im searching to replace it app also locks you in so you cannot export to another app
2,tutorial 
2,great app for your phone but if you need smartwatch functionality look to anydo rather than this app in dialogues with the devs theyve stated they have no intentions of integrating even simple wearos apps like add task from watch uninstalled
2,theres a bug with the planning view you cant see the title of the event other than that the app runs okay
2,great app but isnt optimized for google pixel 3xl i cant resize the widget to match the size of the screen
2,nada es gratis
2,no android wear app
2,i purchased the app all i need now is to add color to the calendar entries mmh ill think of some stuff later
2,dont get any notification at all
2,has some cool features but now that ive used for a while can see has some real limitations and poor performance sometimes unfortunately
2,it was good for a few days but now its not loading on my browser at all gateway timeout and changes i made on my ipad are not syncing to my phone not useful if nothing works
2,fix the lag on moving events on the day display and ill subscribe again ux is clunky get a second opinion
2,the app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay 3 a month just to see a calendar
2,app seems ok but they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar it lets you view the current week anything else and you have to pay so many free ones out there to choose from uninstalling
2,i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i cant add another subscription to the msny i already have
2,i love this app but it reads my texts i left one in draft and it suggested it as a todo item i couldnt find any way to get it to keep is eyes to itself not about it
2,the notification on my tickwatch c2 has no vibration  please fix
2,now not working after pie emui 900 please update or give instructions still not working no option found in settings please help as guided
2,the application is very nive but cant take the complete use of it because of the premium option  and the amount also is high
2,serviceable but not awesome by any means ive spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that i feel like i cant bail even though i dont love it its really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like i want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app
2,works well does more than i need a little awkward setting up reminders 42419 update new app update forces me to read how long ago was the task due and then it shows what it is very very annoying will be looking for a new app if they dont fix this 43019 response pop up notifications show how long was the task due then what it is and i mostly read pop up or slide down from the top disabling countdown doesnt solve the problem
2,nonfunctional with google account was great but cant use right now
2,ticktick please give us students a discount like todoist you lost a user
2,the app is good but the differences between the premium and free version arent mentioned at the beginning it is also not possible to start using the app without the free trial period as far as i have seen after the forced free trial period i now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and app simultaneously is indeed a premium function this seems awful lot like the way evernote took i want to buy my apps because i appreciate the work not because im forced into
2,i love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task its updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening
2,its just a simple to do list  why did you locked some tools 
2,im facing a problem that is reminders are not working properly device lenovo k3 note android 60
2,gawd whats up with the ugly orange and why cant i change it to something more palatable
2,windows 10 version made my computer freak out uninstalling for now
2,when you use the pomo timer it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on there is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise i would like to be able to select the task im working on select what white noise i want and then start the pomo not everything automatically start
2,came back to this after not using it for a while tonnes of updates has made it rubbish
2,mota moti
2,requires access to contacts to work
2,do i have to add tasks daily or can i copy whole list for daily
2,could not get any realtime notification at all enabled all notifications android60 or higher option disabled battery optimization and other security settings the only time i get the notification is when i manually open the app itself but then it has already been past the time set
2,premium is very expensive
2,the features are good but unfair to pay on yearly basis
2,nice app but one feature that makes this app less sense to me their recurring tasks is unnecessarily complicated ie next occurance of an event totally depends on completion of current instancethere is no way to mark a task incomplete despite ive a premium subscription i cant use because of the messed up recurring tasks after your suggestion im seeing all overdue tasks as completed 
2,good idea but i dont like that it wants internet access
2,not too good for android i have the app in my two different type of phones and subscribed for the premium one month in my android and found out that that version doesnt have all the features described as for example impossible to find or use the sub task feature create or editing folders etc etc very disappointed about that because the app concept seems to me very good 
2,the basic app is fine not great but fine however the premium is far too pricey 27 a year for the ability to set a duration on tasks thats crazy
2,i just installed this app on my droid today  when setting up my account i signed in using my gmail account  however i am unable to do that on my laptop  i get an error message when i input the gmail address and password  i was looking for a replacement for googles inbox  i would like something that is accessible on both my phone and my laptop  i guess i need to keep looking
2,i just spent 30 minutes putting tasks into the app then went to sync the app with my google account and they all got erased
2,task management is terrible it will kill the apps running to draw over the screen frequently my camera shuts off because tick tick notification
2,anything with a dash creates an alert which is troublesome to remove eg practice weeks 13 turns into a due date of january 3rd
2,says free its not free its a demo for a paid app be warned
2,very confusing
2,glitches galore currently am unable to see certain options at all as they are blacked out tried deleting  reinstalling resetting phone  changing the theme to different colors its a shame because this is my favorite todo app  was just thinking about biting the bullet  upgrading  if fixed will definitely reconsider
2,app works pretty well but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life their privacy policy needs to get stronger and be better defined we collect your data heres a vague description of what we keep it as long as weve decided we need to and we wont tell you how long that is we also completely change this policy in a way that were break the policy you may have originally agreed to but its your responsibility as the user to make sure we dont break our end of the deal dont like this delete the app  basically the privacy policy not exactly trust encouraging fix this in a privacy friendly way and ill change my review
2,app has everything i need but there is 2 major issues 1 after reverting to standard time all scheduled dates moved to day before im in belarus belarus doesnt revert time as against europe does eg i had repeated task on tuesday and now its scheduled on monday 2 web  android sync  if i change something on web changes dont appear on my android device if i change something on web then open android app and look through tasks then refresh web page all changes done on web are lost it is completely unpleasant and the only reason why i cant buy full version
2,well just one of many reminders has one big drawback  cannot do what it designed for i e remind really missing about astrid
2,its worst app
2,honestly the premium version is just not worth it whats the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if in every case you cant see future recurring events the next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance in order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 as im seeing online and nothing has been done that not only shows poor hindsight whats a calendar without planning but also a strikingly deaf customer service the app is probably just as good as its free version the pomodoro timer is ok but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version
2,the features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access will not buy something with so little real use testing
2,user interface not friendly
2,not good no option to edit tasks or correct spellings once entered setting time and date not intuitive too many steps to make a single entry many other drawbacks not recommended
2,another crappy todo list app i have to delete i dont understand all i want is a simple to do list i keep trying to add an item and it automatically goes into my inbox whatever that means i went to the help center to find a solution but a long list of topics that isnt searchable is completely useless
2,add option remind at specific location instead of time only if this is already there can you please educate me how to use that
2,simplicity but not too simple like google tasks even the free version is alright if it would actually work as promised the attachment function is extremely flaky and unreliable i lost important pictures as i thought they have been secured into the cloud but they havent or just half of the picture no error message was given when uploading via android without the attachment feature ticktick is nothing special compared to similar apps so i deinstalled it
2,this was a great list app then something happened and i stopped getting notifications i checked the app and it said i needed to allow permissions due to android 60 ive been on android 70 since i started using the app but regardless i checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications still didnt work ive tried resetting the phone resetting permissions nothing works now ill try uninstalling it and using something else
2,its good if youre willing to spend so much money how annoying
2,i used to find this app helpful but lately its been malfunctioning and is super annoying it sounds the notification even when theres not a task and its been doing that more and more i even tried to make the alert noise silent but it kept doing the sound even after i changed it made sure every single thing was changed to silent but that didnt help its also stopped popping up the notifications when i do have a task so i often miss things im going to be uninstalling this app and finding one that actually works
2,"when i remove all app in recent i didnt get any notification about my 
event but if i will not remove this in my recent app it will notify i want 
it run or notify me even i close the app and remove from my recent apps"
2,"this app is hard to understand tasks are deleted without warning or they 
are not saved several times i thought i created a reminder only to find it 
wasnt there ive missed appointments because of these issues"
2,"needs at least 1 more level of subtasks to work for me and no restrictions 
on number of subtasks"
2,"almost perfect if the app just have hejri calendar integration like google 
calendar"
2,"since installing it its needed updates every day i just think software 
shouldnt need daily updates"
2,"used to be my fav app for task app but there are many features missing 
themes are paid there is no local back up option i lost my tasks 3 
times 3 times i had to add them again going to tasks now much better 
app"
2,"its ok it has the only decent widget in any todo app but it lacks 
integrations with much of anything no google assistant no wear os no 
ifttt despite pages of user requests on their site severely limits its 
usefulness beyond a very basic todo list on your phone also you cant 
bulk delete completed tasks and the developer said they have no plan to 
implement that finally gave up waiting for the app to grow up"
2,"i looove this app it would give 5 stars if only it would work its 
been bad for crashing for months but i put up with it because i use it so 
much with the last update thigh its even worse i cant put the widget 
on my phone it crashes everytime i try it doesnt give me my reminders 
and crashes half the time i try to use it please fix and ill give 5 
stars"
2,"this application does not pull or push to your google tasks you have to use 
tictic third party service product on all your devices in order for it to 
work i want my money back because when i installed it during the trial it 
seemed to pull my tasks across but now theyre saying it doesnt do google 
tasks"
2,"not a good replacement of wunderlist free version of this app wont let you 
add description to your task and you have limited categories if migrate 
from wunderlist to tick tick and you have lots of categories tick tick 
will immediately ask you to subscribe to thier plan"
2,i find it not user friendly
2,"i used to love this app but like most apps on android its gotten 
progressively worse now i try to add something to my list by clicking the 
 button then i type something in then i hit the send button then it 
looks like its doing something useful then nothing happens ive looked 
and i dont see any setting that im screwing up or anything and the 
default functionality of the to do list probably shouldnt require you to 
change something for something to show up anyway glad i tried this before 
renewing my premium ill go find another app"
2,the widgets require a premium account please mention this so that people like me who want to try the app with the widget will know to look for another app
2,i hate when you say that its such a great app and i download it only to find out that you only get the bare basics for something that is advised as free i could only view one week and the rest of the features were extremely limited as well waste of time
2,i loved this enough to pay for it in the beginning but months ago syncing stopped working altogether no desktop functionality at all kept crashing on s7 edge wont pay for something that never gets fixed
2,в последнее время заметила что при установке действия повторяющегося  каждые четыре в моем случае  в принципе неважно сколько недель это действие будет повторяться через сколько угодно  но только не 4 недели попробовала поставить 28 дней   все то же самое  причём сдвиг идёт даже не на дни а на недели очень непредсказуемо и может подвести вас
2,29e a year for premium is pushing it way too far
2,notifications bar cant collapse also i cant find the completed tasks
2,big fan of gtasks thought id give tick tick a try app stops working constantly and has to be restarted cant find the lists ive made in ticktick and my gtasks have disappeared from phoneand can only be accessed through gmail desktop will not be renewing the monthly subscription
3,if the upgrade free its well was best
3,a kinda like it havent used it for long but ill comeback to review
3,not syncing in background have to launch app and ask to refresh all the time
3,17102020 have nested multi level sub task but not easy to add it have to open a task and got the menu to add one adding sub task is easier in apps like my life organized or dynalist mlo dont have a web version dynalist dont have reminder if i am not wrong
3,great app but it is a ridiculous problem with nesting subtasks its done too easy unintentionally when selecting a task then the task becomes hidden till i scan all the sibling tasks when finally found there is no simple way to unnest the subtask to the root level please please fix the selection feature making subtasking more explicit with a larger drag threshold bug 2 cannot paste a text in the problem reporting form it only allows to select and copy the placeholder text why
3,tiktik was the best but the last 2 version is not good at all the text of havit prompt is very large although i set the text in small and recently the remainder time is showing in the notification panel as an alerm icon of the default alerm apps icon  please fix it
3,所提供的功能都很不錯但uiux還需加強希望能簡化一些設置步驟
3,it is very useful in your daily life it helps u to set reminders of everything 
3,the pomo section of this app though a great item still malfunctions at times when its set sometimes even though the pomo time set is not complete it closes by itself and shows complete and gives option to relax also it vanishes after some minutes from the notification even though ive removed all battery saving options on tick tick and also given it permission to autostart and run in background this pomo function still keeps malfunctioning kindly fix this issue i use a redmi
3,great app but for months the auto sync on collaborative lists is broken as of a recent update they still havent fixed it confirmed on several devices
3,i love the app the ui simplicity and features but if it was possible to add upto 3 contributors in the free version it would have been better
3,your program is very good i only have a problem with changing its language for example when i change its language to persian some of its words are persian and some are english and it does not change please correct it thank you for your good program that has made my program very regular in life
3,ive been using ticktick for over a year the tool works but the user interface needs work just changing the date on a task takes to many steps the whole user interface could use an overhaul i wish it had a feature that would save me time every day id like a button to take all tasks that are overdue and move them to today update oct 6 2020 latest ticktick update is worse than previous versions im afraid ill be seeking a new todo list app
3,hi a
3,it is awsome if you know how to control it
3,you should add one time payment option along with subscription
3,for the most part i find this app works well however there are some issues with sync that make it difficult to fully recommend this app without hesitation heres hoping that sync issues will be ironed out sooner rather than later
3,finding hard to naviagate
3,can we have the option to create sub tasks under individual tasks without making a new list also i would like to see a notes feature finally pomo is only avsilable for 120min what do i do to see how many hours i spent on a task like studying in a day
3,its good app but not great i use it on my phone and tablet and its great for keeping track of things that need to get done but it doesnt sync between devices well you have to manually open the app on both devices to get to sync which completely bypasses the purpose of the widget
3,its a good application  but it dont tell me what should l do know however i put tasks in different time to notec me 
3,i bought the premium version the app is good but the pomodoro timer is a let down after i downloaded the white noise i found that the very next day i must redownload the white noise again
3,overall a good app synchronization is terrible constantly losing information when using multiple devices one can make changes on a computer and not see changes on the phone for minutes if you close the computer app immediately you may never see those changes really its 2 star but the app is great compared to other trash on the market
3,quite good
3,not so good without premium 
3,bizarre task app you add a task and then tap some strange icons like tags etc that seem to do nothing in particular then you send it to an inbox for reasons unknown you then have to click through two more screens to tap it again just to add a reminder and set the time to make all that official theres a tiny check at the top of the screen to tap then nothing really no confirmation or summary nothing you have to double check that you got it right also updates do nothing laborious
3,hey i love the app but i think you need to slow down on the feature adding process i am not sure i like the idea of tick tick transforming into a note taking app i have other apps for that developers want to put everything in their app but that just adds to the clutter
3,the upgrade if it was free that well be special
3,جيد جدا
3,what a pity to finally found wunderlist alternative app however i cant use this beautiful design app because there is no notification for all the activities in any sharing list except directly mentioned that person name how to mention everyone name in every comment come on dev you can do such a great job so far this is just a setting to receive notification receive all or just for be mentioned wunderlist becomes the best because of user feedback dont let the world down 
3,amazing app but ufortunately all of this functional tools are not free  i couldnt add more than five habits  need to upgrade to premium hopefully for next update this app could be give more benefits in tools 
3,is ok however you cannot download older versions for the mac this quite annoying have to work with web version or buy a new mac so much for sustainability
3,i really want to love this app it seems perfect for me but unfortunately the reminders dont go off unless you go into the app
3,app is good but habit notification doesnt make any sound
3,the free version does just about enough for my requirements but no more limited sharing and reminders are less than generous but it works well enough
3,lots to like but inbox doesnt work as expected adding dates to tasks does not remove them from inbox so all your tasks stay in inbox and its impossible to organize please fix this conflicts with your support site guide
3,i dont know why the stick notifications not working i have been checked my all settings but i could not find whats the problem
3,unfortunately therere lots of rtl issues please fix it asap and get 5 stars as you deserve
3,the tab bar of ticktick 580 version has bigger icons than before and they didnt look compatible with android version its like safe mode options in windows but ipad version has best view anyway would you like to fix it and the font size would it be smaller thank you 
3,sync could use real work needs a manual option for when working with multiple devices other cloud services can be seen to work immediately on a second device theres zero settings for synchronization
3,tick tick should also inform us about the clashes when two things are scheduled at the same time
3,have used ticktick for years one of my most necessary apps but the font sizing is not working and has reset to the normalsmallest size i may need to start wearing glasses just to read my own lists 
3,i noticed a slight anomaly in the app if you start focus for a subtask eg subtaskx of taskx then why isnt that focus time added to the total time of taskx that subtaskx does fall under the taskx so any time invested in subtaskx should also be added into the main taskx otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of subtaskx if it is independent of the taskx i hope you will focus on this issue thanks edit1 the app has a lot of useful features but they are often hard to find simplify it
3,not as smooth as i hoped
3,some good features but overall mediocre compared to my old wunderlist if someone shares a list with me i cannot easily join the list the list is not auto synced with my profile instead im sent an email with a join list button but even when i click the button i am taken to the generic sales page to download the app
3,failed to meet my expectations since it is a editors choice like to say good but not userfriendly i would like to say cant set reminder easily i think its too innovative to follow
3,i love this app because i could set the widget transparency bg so it would appear neater as a whole with the phone wallpaper but when i press a task complete the list that i made then all gone on the widget saying i have no task today i experience this on daily basis and in the end have to open the app to make edit on task and etc hope this bug could be fixed soon
3,it is great app for civil engineers like me as it helps me to planout my todos everyday but the thing is on my realme x2 pro the alarms are hit n miss even after following instructions for keeping it active pls fix it 
3,best app pls allow to add upto 10 habits in free version 
3,i love the app but i am unable to login on my new device my internet is working fine 
3,q oo z a 446eonamaste
3,a call reminder feature is absolutely needed
3,its a good app for reminders
3,sometimes dont show reminders
3,no doubt this app is amazing and this app deserve 5 star but i am frustrated because this app doesnt keep log more than 90 days i wish it could kept forever
3,just as i was about to rate this 5 stars it only let me have 16 subtasks its stupid let us have more subtasks and ill give you guys 5 stars
3,its a good app there are many amazing functions but there ads are very annoying
3,good for a long time but recently it became unusableit would always freeze up
3,i love this program could be 5 stars but a task adds tick tick to the shared text in the paid version this not good and means you have to remove it every time worse is the developer response i got below clearly indicates they do not understand usability issues reported from good users  you can remove the ticktick information manually really not a good suggestion for a productivity product
3,it seems nice and simple it has proper instructions however theres no option to save it to sd card and i need the space on my phone so im likely going to have to delete it
3,the app is not compatible to read my notifications on my wrist bandall other apps notifications do workall settings are set on my phone to make sure i receive the notifications but in vainplease make an update for thisany update on this issue please
3,lately from past two days i am facing difficulty using widget getting an error task list not found whenever i strike off a task please look into it asap
3,everything fine but dont have email reminders
3,i love the app however i absolutely hate that i cant change one reoccurring task time and duration without changing the repeats after it please fix this this app would be way better if it had this function like google calendar does
3,fyi adding more reminders is not free you need to buy the premium version
3,decent used to be better now the tag stays on the text entry line so you have to manually erase the tag between each entry very annoying i went back to notepad and pencil after this update
3,no transparent theme
3,only the premium version is good
3,please fix the scheduling that changes to jan 1st 1970 when selecting any day i can only schedule using the today tomorrow and next monday buttons not the calendar this was present for over 2 months by now also smart text detection doesnt work at all for  on tommorow at 600pm  for example please fix these 2 issues
3,widget is slow
3,i simply love ticktick but am growing weary of the widgets not updating if i open the app they update after a minute or so however if i dont need to use the app therefore not opening it the widgets stop updating after some amount of time is there a setting im missing or do i need to not optimize tickticks battery use edit in addition actions taken via the widget do not update the appwebsite until i open the app explicitly
3,its ok a bit messy
3,too much options getting me confused and more complexity
3,this app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors dont clearly have potential to be the best in the market cons  sync issues time to load up in windows 10 bugs in habit tracker  tasks
3,i cannot login to the app
3,only allowed 9 lists for free need to purchase for additional listssuch a bummer wunderlist was much better but i had to switch over as they closed tick tick is not so straightforward to sync with another user
3,monthly widget needs to be premium
3,im really enjoy your app but where is subfolders this is very useful feature especially for gtd method launch this feature please and ill change my rate at 10 stars 
3,i newly installed this app it works basically good but i havent been happy with its user interface for example there is no feature showing all weekly or monthly tasks in a table i would like to see my future plans at one glance without scrolling down
3,excellent  application but i wish to add arabic language thank you
3,most probably its my choice since wunderlist closing but why are you guys so persistent in denying email notifications feature app really often skip reminders
3,there is too much white everywhere what happened to assigning colors to folders add some more theme colors like purple please the latest update added color to the calendar widget for events can you please give us the option to choose the colors also please bring back the old completion sound lowered rating because your android wear app hasnt been updated since 2015 please fix to work with 20 i really love this app but may have to move on if it wont work on my watch
3,good app it will be better if the user could set duration of task  for example in reading or studing or every task which need to be more focused on it  i use flip app beside tick tick app for this purpose thank you
3,calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky cant see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists organize view cant use custom lists to plan my week the sync with google is unforgivably poor if i change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in ticktick this is so bad i have begun looking for replacement i would like to see a better support forums for community feedback often answers are basically suck it up thats just the way it is
3,so close to being my dream todo app it claims to support start times but actually doesnt you can record the start and due time but you cant then filter a list to only show a task that has in fact started ie what can i work on now for me this makes start times nothing more than a tag that i cant interact with which totally defeats the point
3,lack of experience between platforms premium purchase not synced very well some good points like custom alerts and reminders
3,why not find arabic language
3,ive been a long time fan and user of ticktick but man i have to say these past updates doesnt really feel right sure it does look great but my weekly tally of focused hours is gone before the update viewing of stats offline wasnt a problem but now come on guys also why did you remove the weekly focused hours and made it a premium feature thats just so sad
3,the new update has removed the repeat task option i dont know where to find it
3,what happened since your last update every time i drag items to a different time or different order as soon as i leave the app they go back to where they were please fix this i want to set the order also the google calendar items after the end of july are missing does the free version no longer sync with google calendar nothing there after the beginning of may
3,всё отлично но не работает таймер помодоро
3,smart todo app 1 location feature needs cell towers option instead of gps battery killer 2 sorting needs many levels eg by location then project list then date 3 priority needs 1 to 99 list items tasks where due dates are not important very good app otherwise the cell tower function could be like a button to capture connected cell towers ids for say 5 to 60mins then tasks are triggered if phone connectsdisconnects to one of the saved tower ids different locations have
3,so much potential still learning but loving it con when tasks go to notification bar i have option to mark complete or snooze when i tap on either it freezes my phone for up to 10 to 12 secs sometimes get ui isnt responding why
3,better than microsoft todo google tasks boosted wunderlist but still not great because it does not have the simplicity and app taskevent logic i am looking for
3,ok but its not different as my phones app
3,the statistics show i missed everything in a day even though i completed 90 of the tasks
3,decent todo app for single user home screen widget does not receive remote updates
3,3rd may 2020 it was very long time back requested for the feature to enable notifications for the actions done by shared members which still i am waiting for
3,you need to make a clear all data or reset everything button i had to delete my account because it triple synced and i wanted all this mess gone and i couldnt please consider it
3,good basic lists i would like to create more lists but the annual fee for unlimited lists is too out there
3,good app but very complicatedcumbersome ui you have multiple places where the tasks can get hidden  then youll forget which defeats the whole purpose simpler design would help greatly going to switch back to google keep soon
3,this is good app
3,i was little starting to be comfortable comparing to other appunless the premium came up i dont any personal ac to pay just to get reminded where multiple remider doesnt worki literally start loving and hate at the same timeu cant get multiple unless u get premium this aint my app
3,thanks for this apps its fells great
3,ticktick is not a bad app by any means but it is too complicated for my needs so i just went back to using google keep which also has an excellent sync system with its website equivalent ticktick is especially complex when it comes to the scheduling of alerts which always confused me to the point where i didnt understand how to set the reminders that i wanted ticktick is a fantastic app but it is quite confusing i prefer simplicity in the notetaking and reminder apps that i use
3,jury is still outwould be more than happy to reviewif i was actually given the time to do so before the rate me rate me messages
3,i have just started using this app and it looks great  except for the drop down menu from the 3 dots which doesnt show the full menu and you cannot scroll down in it either please fix this
3,need some options and need to be more organaise
3,i paid for a year subscription based off the demo having not used googles own free task manager big mistake all i needed was googles free version of the same thing in fact they are almost identical moral of the story dont pay for this unless you are in extreme taskmaster
3,please make a more sleek widget please
3,its impossible to sort completed list its very inconvenient im waiting for this feature for 2 years wo any hope for a success
3,i cant scroll the widget or other screens ill probably subscribe if this gets reliably fixed since wunderlist is dead now
3,has the potential to be an excellent all in one calendar and todo list however i cancelled my subscription two weeks in as 1 subtasks automatically repeat when repeating main task is completed regardless of time and due date settings this should be optional 2 subtask reminders should be optional 3 calendar functions are very limited eg ability to set up an event rather than a task would be a valuable addition
3,pomdoro is bad
3,i needed a replacement for wunderlist which we relied on for task lists for our business  employees with ticktick i had to manually type in each task for each list because the import feature only put them in my inbox theres no home screen  hitting the return arrow exits the app not a biggie just an adjustment the real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person collaboration was an important feature we needed using microsofts to do for now
3,can add a reminder option withthe specified time
3,unnecessarily complex a simple one dimensional version would be fine
3,its good but its size is large
3,jus started using so far i like it
3,useless edit thanks for replying i wish the tasks could be repeated every day like in a morning routine that is done everyday to give the user a sense of having a productive morning or something 
3,very helpful with lots of features i would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though also it would be delightful if we could add tasks like the notification with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up but still nothing i would pay annually though
3,this is a good app however it has a few bugs that need attention that could easily make the app 5 stars
3,just upgraded to premium version app and google play list subscription at 2799 i got charged 2984 
3,if time tracking was added and the parserinterface of the what would you like to do field was fixed this alone is making me want to switch back to amazing marvin i would rate 5 stars
3,does not work on galaxy watchit would be so perfect if it would the app is the best though but how can an app built for planning and reminding not work with something as basic as a smartwatch makes no sense
3,nice one
3,great app but missing integration with goggle assistant or automatuon apps like ifttt many apps do this now ticktick is falling behind
3,hi im using the paid one on my phone and ipad however i find that they do not sync well on both like i already marked 3cups of water on my phone then whem i open on ipad its not marked but then both updated according to the ipad how do i make this better also can there be a way to skip a habit sometimes i missed it and i dont want them to keep appearing on the list
3,it could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying
3,i have the premium version i had been using wunderlist the most amazing todo app ever and very intuitive tick tick has worked well as wunderlist is no longer supported however some key things i truly miss push notifications when someone texts within the app notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list copy and paste everything i need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list
3,experiência muito boa mas tem muito a ser feito
3,so far its okay as task apps go im a wunderlist refugee because microsoft bought them out and they destroy everything perhaps tick tick will grow on me well see
3,در زبان فارسی به علت راست چین بودن تقویم ماه از راست به چپ ولی ایام هفته از چپ به راست چیده شده و تطابق ندارند لطفا اصلاح کنید
3,good as it is simple and effective it could be more enhanced
3,good app but in free version they should add more features just like reminder with time duration i like its feature of description in which we can add sub task and tick then
3,generally good but has issues adding a subtask is just weird  why they cant do what wunderlist does with a place to add or a button and its all a bit sluggish with some redraw problems but it has some great ideas to it so maybe itll be good in time
3,hi long time ticktick user unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed local calendars recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now the last time it worked properly was in 521 i notified you guys a long time ago but it hasnt been fixed i finally tried anydo and it works properly with my local calendar so it seems that i will be giving them my subscription money this year
3,back button doesnt work
3,ticktick is one of my favourite productivity app but suddenly the habit tracker doesnt work or respond properly
3,you have to subscribe for the pro version id rather just have one flat fee
3,love this app i used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load
3,too many items
3,i would buy if there was onetime only purchase i cant pay monthly and its still enough to use without premium but i want premium and one time purchase 
3,all awesome except widgets they randomly and annoyingly often stop working phone either needs to be restarted or widgets readded or both
3,the best looking todo app i could find very complete would be the one i use but unfortunately sync with google calendar takes hours up to a day the issue seems to be a couple of years old you can check it in the customer section on their website and nothing was done to address it while the competition syncs in seconds if you dont need google sync then its great im now using another app sad
3,nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
4,amazing i started using this recently and i regret that i didnt use it any earlier
4,its a really good app it help me manage my time better and know what im meant to be doing per time  more productivity only downside ive noticed is if you set a recurring tasklets say everyday egg comes up and you dont mark it as complete the next time egg comes up and you do it you cant mark it as complete so you have to find the place where you didnt do egg and mark it as complete to mark todays own as complete as well maybe theres something to curb this i dont know yet
4,because of this app i could organize my time from morning to evening go download this app
4,ive had an issue with a habit since may i tried contacting support by email opening a ticket via the application but no one was helpful its a shame that such a good application has one of the worst customer support team update the issue was finally resolved
4,when sorting tasks via list if they also sort the individual list items by time would have been more convenient
4,nesting looks to work much better now with a way to even revert easily still wish there was an option to turn it off but i can live with it the way theyve got it now great app good for anydo users or folks still sore about wunderlist
4,satisfied better than the most of the apps in this category
4,very helpfull does a very good job when typing an action or notes its very slow on an lg smartwine phone
4,самое лучшее приложений для управления задачами но ограничение в 99 задач в списке  это полная глупость
4,the reason i chose this app but not the others is because of the way the reminder works  i considered the upgrade but its expensive for me as a student and no one time payment hope therell be student discount
4,very good app but please update in widget
4,its very useful but i hope becoming free
4,nice app useful for to remember tasks
4,its really the app that ive been looking for but it would be nice if there was a tab for a customizable timetable and that the features to add multiple attachments became a free feature if these are added it would be the perfect app for most people
4,has so many bugs its keep crashing
4,in timeline view widget please fix presence of free unused space on bottom and align the event caption to the length and width please
4,its a good app i do use it alot but there are problems with it like if you put 2 or more reminders in a habit the notification wont work and my other problem is with the premium if you have money you can have better features and during these times you would prefer to save up but the app is great i do recommend it
4,i had a greiveance but it is resolved other than that the app is good
4,i think its a good app
4,multifunction app that help you remember everything and anything and force you to be more productive
4,muy buen app el servicio es adecuado para ser gratuito
4,dear ticktick please add the redo and undo option because its absence i cant recover my just cut data which cut by mistake during copypaste procedure please add this feature
4,well performing
4,what happened this app was working great until this latest update now its losing tasks left and right lost 4 today please back out this latest update until it is properly debugged update other reviews gave me a clue to what has been happening its creating subtasks i now have 5 subtasks i never wanted and linked to totally unrelated tasks further update sliding is what is creating subtasks its too sensitive and its impossible to not slide while pressing to select a task
4,good but no have arabic language
4,its been amazing to use tick tick
4,if only it had a dark splash screen i have set the dark theme in the app to keep it easy on my eyes at night but that bright splash screen just ruins it i know that googles apps do the same thing and its absolutely stupid
4,best
4,it will be nice if the week calender view open in free
4,this app helps me stay sane while working from home juggling errands and work it frees my mind from trying to remember what i need to do and focus on the task at hand however im experiencing occasional issues when using the pomo timer
4,great app but why not improve sync function on wear os i have to buy another todo app only because it has better support on wear os so please improve it and make me only pay for this app
4,58x crashes still 572 works habits widget improved but lacking needs also single column layout for habits widget the good 1 habits 2 pomo timer 3 dark theme 4 sorting lists only paid the bad 1 too expensive to use basic features make it 10 lifetime 2 social aspect lacks needs public leaderboard open to free users  search find  add users 3 no backup feature use titanium backup share option ok but only one list need full backup export all 4 need 100 offline
4,habit reminder suits me best streak feature good easy making notes at first it took me some time to figure out the app but now m able to the tags thing is a bit complicated i wanted the learning tags for eg to appear in today list when i make them that day but it doesnt otherwise good calendar feature and snooze feature awesome
4,its good for handling
4,cool apps
4,nice app you can organize tour day you will not forget things anymore
4,not to be confused with tiktok a clearly inferior alternative
4,if there was a way to set a recurring task 5 stars overall great app and love the layout  very functional
4,decent todoist and anydo have a bit better features especially the premium versions
4,could not live without it its simple but has everything i need i would buy a premium version if it was a one time purchase not a subscription  id love to see consistent design between platforms
4,i wish it would give mote puch and be little more user friendly altogether a great app
4,notes are great idea but without endtoend encryption they are useless to me
4,im using this app for notes and it is almost perfect except it cant create subfolders please add this feature and it would be the perfect evernote replacement
4,this app helps you to get productive by reminding you about the tasks you need to complete howey there is a lot of room for further improvements there should be quick mechanism for setting the time and date for the tasks ui can be much better there should be goal setting and habit development mechanism
4,i love the ability to see my todo items synced with my google cal that way i can drag my tasks to whenever i want and plan my day out the only reason im giving the app 4 stars is because recurring google calendar events show up multiple times in the same day on the calendar view i contacted their customer support they responded sorry there is no setting for that but i will note it down as a feature request to our product team for future consideration its not a settingits a bug
4,i use this app all the time with great benefit 4 stars instead of 5 because of crappy support when i had a technical problem with the app
4,excellent app has taken all the information but after buying the premium app began creepy lagging switching tabs and leaking lagging use impossible support still not answered
4,please add 2 way sync to google calendar with minimal delay
4,simple yet effective
4,very effective app it pushes you to complete your task you entered in the app have timers which is the best too amazing app 
4,one suggestion i hope the widget can adapt to systemwide dark mode
4,i prefer this app because of a cleaner ui and pomodoro timer but in terms of features it loses to todoist and other apps for example when you past link it stays ugly in other apps it transforms to smthn meaningful
4,so so
4,functional features are very simple and effective to use not combersome great job
4,its a amazing app but when i add task from windows its not automatically updating on my android widget i have to open app to update
4,very nice app ben using it for years
4,i love how it reminds me my supposed to do very useful for my daily routine
4,it has the most qualities i want in an app like this
4,i like this app its can handle my daily tasks i recommended anybody to use it very useful if there are any problems will appears in future i will spot it but for now all things are okay  thanks so much 
4,this is the first time im sticking with a todo list kind of app so far so good
4,great app life is so much easier only thing missing is a public api and support for automated backups please let me own my data
4,pretty much exactly what i was looking for time entry can be a little bothersome as it uses the analog clock but otherwise great
4,great app so far could be a little more engaging though with pop ups trophies animations when you complete a task however it does help to keep you on track with your tasks
4,this application opens slowly when i click it
4,enjoying this app
4,great way to prioritize
4,could you please make sure that the cases postponed to tomorrow retain their positions
4,1 it would be great if you have the auto delete completed tasks after a certain time feature in the widget 2 show the task that have been accidentally ticked for a couple of seconds so that i can undo the action i know i can do that in the app but its just more convenient for me if you have this feature in the widget
4,nice app easy to use
4,app is great especially pomodoro modecan u include a click to count the no of time taken to study in a day etc along with that
4,love the design of app please provide export options reason for not giving 5 
4,good so far
4,best task app out there only thing its missing is 2fa to keep accounts safe
4,تطبيق قائمة مهام ممتازة للأمانة  وايضا يقدم داخل التطبيق تقويم وايضا هناك اداة لصنع عادات  ولكن كل الميزات ومن ضمنها قائمة المهام والتقويم وساعة التركيز يمكن الحصول عليها من تطبيقات اخرى لدي  لذا سأفضلها على هذا التطبيق
4,till now the experience is quiet amazing honestly i became more organized using this app
4,good clean app no crash issues no data loss easy to use widget
4,it helps to do tha things in better way  
4,my life has officially been put together
4,nice app as i wanted
4,best planner app theres more to it than any simple work planner app highly customisable and easy to use
4,items added in calendar view do not appear in list view which is my primary reference it would be nice to have as an option
4,請問繁體中文什麼時候才能支援農曆真的很喜歡這個 app 也訂閱好幾年了但一直有這個缺點
4,nice app best planner in play store good app for busy people
4,the pomo in the ticktick website doesnt register the pomos i cant seem to see any pomos from when im using the website in the pomo stats section in the app
4,alhamdulillah it is a nice app but its reminding timer is not accurate most of the time it doesnt work on time please fix it thanks
4,would have loved to give it 5 stars but the alarm does not works properly sometimes changed all required settings but it still misses some alarms other than that its the best to do list app i have ever seen and the pomodoro is just awesome
4,so far ive really liked tick tick simple and easy to create schedule and organize tasks i really like how habits are integrated too please add some more features to habits let me put them in calendar view i work mostly in the calendar view so it would be so amazing to have the habits there instead of having to create them as a task as well it seems redundant please let me put habits in lists or tag them
4,نمیشه برای صفحه رنگی انتخاب کرد برای همین یه ستاره کم کردم وگرنه خیلی خوبه
4,pomos dont vibrate my phone
4,this is nice app
4,its amazing ok i was really happy with the ability to create list and then a task and furthermore a subtask with a customizable reminder for each however the problem start there when you turn off the popup notification and only rely on the regular notification panel it just shows the the subtask name with no additional infos of the main task or the list not even the tag or the customized color is included with it i really sometimes find it difficult to identify the subtask hopefully you fix it
4,quando digito data ou tag o texto do comando fica na tarefa por exemplo estudar today rotina  templates o atalho pra editar eles podia ser mais visível e ter a opção de apagar tudo de uma vez inbox e botão de pesquisa podia ter a opção de acessar eles na tap bar
4,nice experience
4,setting periodic tasks is hard to get used to
4,bulk voice sms broadcaster improvement this feature in your aap plsss
4,actually like the new pomodoro statistics update but the bar chart has a flaw i cant see the exact number of hours but rather an estimate because the exact hours arent written onto the days like they were before itd be great if you could fix that otherwise love it
4,it is truly amazing app for productivity i wish to give 5 star but many features are not available in the free version thats the reason im giving 4star
4,aplicación fácil de usar y muy práctica para el manejo de tareas que ofrece herramientas útiles para crear rutinas y administrar mejor el tiempo sus opciones para planear recordar y planear tareas ayudan a que estas no se dejen de ejecutar por descuido para mejorar tiene la forma en la que se visualiza el formato enriquecido
4,im a todo list kinda person i rely pretty heavily on them because my memory is  i like that this syncs with my google calendar i also like the satisfying little sound when i check a little box to mark a task complete what can i say its the simple things in life  i especially like that i can schedule tasks and reminders waaaaay the heck ahead of time wouldve given 5 stars but honestly id really like a little more text options fonts colors etc
4,so far it does what i need
4,for habits statistics please add graphics of weeks and months progression
4,just what i was looking for simple lightweight app that syncs my todo lists a between android windows  mac very nice
4,great app  could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list
4,achchha app hai magar kabhi kabhi dikkat aati hai usse fix karna jaruri hai
4,some lag in sync but otherwise good
4,pretty good good app does what i need it to do
4,routine tasks if not finished are shown as an overdue please give an option to auto mark any specific routine tasks as incomplete rather than overdue
4,works great i enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer
4,bring the gantt view
4,this seems to tick ha most of the boxes multiple to do lists habit tracking pomodoro timer the only place i wish it were better is in statistics and graphs of habit and to do completion
4,that is really useful for me i can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and   if u can add note for writing notes and  and something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now tnx
4,its amazing apart from the fact that it reminds me of you events from yesterday
4,very very very good program it provides to me allmost what i need to manage my aims  planing for my dreams it also enhance my productivity along the time bec it has a full view about my own time days weeks months years  id like to purchase the program premium plan in the future if i started to use it almost
4,good few tweaks to be great
4,it is need to support arabic language
4,pretty good app helps get things done easy to use no issues yet
4,pretty good
4,it could make some more features available for free versionsso it would be the better
4,this app was really good so far this is the best app i used to stay on track but i hate it when i need to pay for premium please make it free
4,no doubt its the best productivity app it is very smooth and customizable i liked the idea of adding a pomo timer  habit tracker having all this features made this app unique  amazing but the prize of the premium package is little high thats why im not gonna give you 5 stars anyway its a great app 
4,i downloaded this app and i didnt expect much but its honestly amazing i love the simple layout and everything about it i love that you can add or delete tools like for me i wanted to have a habit tracker and i could simply enable that i can clearly see why it is editors choice recommend it to everyone  edit you can only do 5 habits with subscription sadly
4,terimakasih sudah membantu
4,easy n accurateuser friendly app voice to text funtion is also very helpful
4,good but i cant figure out some things like id rather have undated things listed above my next yearly reminders that dont happen for another year
4,good little to do app but how can you activate the sync feature 
4,this app is almost perfect and a league above the others however there is one thing missing and it is the ability to have repetitive tasks suppose i want to grow the habit of brushing my teeth every night i dont want to keep creating the same tak every day so the ability to have daily tasks this app is still the best and much better than its competitors
4,this is a very good app but it doesnt quite meet my needs i canceled my account but they kept charging me for months i finally got through to their customer service and they refunded all my money i have adjusted my review to reflect this otherwise this app is well thought out and worth trying
4,some things should be made easier like typing in the tasks one after the other easily without having to press save and new everytime
4,helps me accomplish my tasks
4,this app has all the features and customisation required in a task mgmt app and the developer is proactive  what freaks me is doubts about data security as the company is based out of hong kong
4,pretty good some bugs
4,its a good app it has everything which a study app require or morebut only it doesnt have ranking system
4,so simple and user friendly
4,godd
4,im not sure if this is something you can fix but since my samsung phone got the android 10 update the widgets are very small so many great features very flexible with lists auto lists and tags different ways to view and sort your tasks a great calendar view that also allows you to just see your events in the background really like the pomo timer with white noise as well great to have also have habit tracking in the same app just switched from monthly to yearly premium subscription
4,good app to keep track of the todo list
4,it is a fun appp
4,a very cool program we want arabic
4,does this app have auto sync with google account
4,really well done and fills the void wunderlist left thank you for this app and thank you for making it free
4,this works very well awesome app
4,i loved the app so much  it is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas i think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable
4,good but some more ease is needed
4,the widget is quite imlressive
4,just what i needed would give 5 if it had time tracker
4,ive been using ticktick for probably 4 years and its the best todo list app out there its simple and straightforward and i love that i can have it on all of my devices and computer and keep one to do list wherever i go i would love to give it 5 stars but over the last few months its been very glitchy with syncing between my various devices
4,i definitely recommend it
4,great better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or all view despite priority or reminder time that option is what sets it above wish that android reminders were full screen however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time view in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns
4,great app but i would like to see todos within todos i mean like when u click a todo it should open more subtodos then i surely give you 5 stars
4,its user friendly love using it
4,like this app it had everything i expected a todo list to do so i have no complaints
4,it gives notification on time which mostly apps dont give
4,love this app would like to say thanks for creating this app three star only because calendar is bit buggy one is there are no real time syncing with google calendar which force me to use tickticks calendar which is not convenient for me
4,better than others but i have problem in the beginning ill let you know later
4,i loved this app so much though the notifications doesnt work if youre not online but overall its the best todo list app ive used
4,hey even after optimizing for battery optimization i still get reminders only after i start the app please help 
4,so far felt good
4,i like the design and the flow i just dont like how some features require premium but j guess thats how they make their money so i understand
4,good fun  motivated
4,great app and experience all the features are great
4,its really good app i have been using it for few days really helpful just one thing when i add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks can i change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom thats why given 4 stars
4,this app is amazing very convenient to be honest everything is just there for u to setup the interface looks simple but great especially the dark theme i love it one main thing about this app is that the premium section of it does not overwhelm the user its there but it doesnt shovel itself to the users face compared to the others ive used this is a better deal
4,i really like it the reason im giving a 4 star is that i wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins 120 mins means ive got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus ps im using the free version i dont know whether it available on the premium version or not
4,great app most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already pomo sometimes doesnt work though the timer just gets stuck at 2500 after it starts
4,it is a nice app and really helps me manage my tasks especially study tasksit should also include features like sharing schedule with friends 
4,this app is great really nice for organizing stuff only thing i miss is a monthly overview with statistics
4,really nice but need some more changes
4,i love this app only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesnt dismiss notifications on the others 
4,good but is there a one time fee for this thing i abhor having to pay 299month vs just paying a one time fee
4,very good app for time management
4,looks really good but unfortunately couldnt get to set a customized template
4,tick tick is good but it should add more ring tones please try
4,i actually tried a lot of apps and after 1 year with asana i switched ticktick only 4 stars because the app neither fully supports syncing to google calendar nor does it display the calendar events with the colors which were set in the calendar
4,this was a great tick of thing to get i am more organized now insted of just have paper to do lists i got a digital one this great and think every one shound have it tho at times it can get hard to know how to do stuff but later on you get a hang of iti love it
4,it is good but could be so much better with full google assistant integration
4,absolutely amazing a simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want and see on your phone computer or android wear the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the syncing between devices is a little bit inconvenient often i would make changes to my tasklist on my phone and they would not show up on computer until i went back into the app and manually refreshed it
4,i like the fact that you can put some tasks for everyday  and you can classify the tasks by list but i would rather if it can give me my productivity rate after every week  month based on the number of tasks completed
4,pretty good does what i need it to do
5,current review please add feature insert picture with task last review awesome
5,had some weird hiccups and things to first figure it out but got it going smoothly love the option to share todo lists and the integration with other calendars stand alone web version also good widget isnt great but all around a very solid app no intrusive ads and a robust free version that is still worth using it you dont want to pay the monthly fee highly recommend trying it out
5,best task manager app ive tried they all have their quirks and shortcomings but ticktick is overall the most complete of them
5,optional
5,love how its user friendly on all my devices
5,يا خويا يا خويا
5,absolutely incredible app definitely getting premium it has every feature you could imagine
5,one of the best productivity apps ever in my opinion and ive seen a lot of them
5,best todo app  habit  perfect project mangement tool all in one
5,pomo is good
5,best app reminder ever ive tried
5,incredible task management app absolutely love it they have all the features i could possibly want so impressed by its functionality and versitility i use on both my windows computer as well as my android phone i put literally everything i need to do on it so it helps me out greatly so appreciative of ticktick thank you hope its here to stay im enjoying the updates too highly recommend
5,when you think you are satisfied they surprise you with more 
5,useful very convenient
5,amazing it gets the job done literally
5,2018 better than anydo in managing tasks since they integrated pomodoro you dont spend alot of time in it to manage your tasks and thats a good thing you spend your time actually doing your tasks todoist are just too complicated and wunderlist are too simple 2020 update still the best out there even with the new microsoft todo this one does adapt to your own workflow this is also perfect for 1 to 2 person team or consultants
5,good app for monitor day to day activities
5,this is really well built simple useful and good looking 
5,ive been looking for an app like this for ages finnaly found the best todo app in the world for me much much better than todoist where you have to pay even for reminders sic here you have almost everything for free you have to try it
5,its got all the features and comforts you could wish for even in the free version looks good works well got no ads its a nobrainer coming from a guy whos tried all of the alternatives this is by far the best and not by exclusion
5,it helped me a lot
5,this app has changed the entire course of my life from health to relationships and productivity this app is a life saver one suggestion regarding habits it would be good if it has all the quotes relating to that habit and so those quotes maybe along with pictures pop up every day on reminder and motivate you as am example if i want to go to gym in reminder i am shown random quote written on some inspirational picture
5,perfect tasking partner
5,this for me is the best planner app i have come across i have tried and used many apps but each one lacked some or the other feature but ticktick has all the features i need and the app is so easy to use this app is helping me plan better stay organized and get things done keep up the great work
5,its just wooooow this is an amazing app it has almost all features that u need without upgrading to premium there literally no adds wich i loooove  a plus i really want the calendar i wish if they could made it free ㅠㅅㅠ anyway this app is loove  waaaaaaay better than todoist

5,works good
5,please return all those old white noises i loved them while i am happy for the new ones its better if the old ones were retained
5,very customizable and full of branching
5,premium version is the best calendar app i could find i tried to avoid paying and spent a long time reading reviews but for all apps something crucial was missing from free version in this case calendar integration with google didnt sync properly so i switched to the premium version so i can use ticktick as my only calendarif youre trying to use free version this is pretty annoying its cheap though slightly cheaper than the main competitor todoist so im fine with paying
5,this is excellent does exactly what you need it to do recommended if you just want a simple task  reminder app
5,superb very easy to schedule  use
5,this app is really great
5,with the recent addition of recursive sub tasks ticktick really offers the bestinclass pm  task management tool for solos key features crossplatform including windows very useful smart lists beautiful android widgets true drag n drop and a very clean ui on all platforms very stable  no crashes in the last 3 years very fast on all platforms tickticks features are as usable as many highend workgroup solutions only downside is tech support can be slow to respond
5,best to do habit toolo have used

5,this should be default calendar app by now give us that option
5,i love it userfriendly simple and has got everything i need
5,its great for catching up with assignments 
5,needed this a lot using this a lot has become a part of my daily life edit thank you so much once again for this great app
5,i dont usually do reviews but i wrote this one  because this app has helped me very much easy to use and very time efficient love it
5,since joining their very affordable monthly subscription ive found ticktick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine and its actually helping me be more productive even though im a pretty begrudging procrastinator first off the widgets god i love the widgets the first thing i see after unlocking my phone is a a list of all the stuff i need to be doing on that given day and b a cute visual checklist of daily habits that i need to also make time for this was what i found was missing back when i used the todoist app was a simple means of having both habits and todos living in the same shared ecosystem i suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features but whats here is perfectly functional and easily integrates into your regular inboxtoday lists the widgets update dynamically right along with the fullscreen app and also with the pc and web integrations this was a musthave feature because ive tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget and seeing them refreshed into existence several minutes later in the app itself ticktick makes everything instant to the point that a ticktick notification pings on my phone at the precise moment it also pings on my laptop i really cant understate how useful the widget and crossplatform integration is because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what im meant to be doing at any random moment its so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important taskshabits slap me in the face demanding my attention this also ties in nicely with the way notificationsalerts work ive got reminders set on all my habits and when the reminders go off they actually take over the entire screen at which point i can tick them off or dig into the more extensive options on the backend theres a few areas i can see for qualityoflife improvements though im optimistic that their subscription model means we havent seen the final iteration of this app for some time yet a few things that jump out at me over a couple months usage  to mark a habit as incomplete you cant just doubletap the checkbox for an x mark you have to open the app pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard go into its settings and the option is buried all the way in the apps backend menus its a minor gripe but when compounded over weeks or months of use its easy to just not bother marking your failures at all it makes me wonder if theres other useful features ive missed just because theyre not readily accessible on the front end ui  widgets  it would be nice if habits displayed in the widget  frontend ui had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on streak for you can track those metrics but again its hidden in the robustyetopaque backend accessible via submenus and abstract graphs rather than being loudly displayed frontandcentre id probably be more motivated to keep the streak going with a given habit if i could see at a splitsecond glance how todays efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days or whatever also you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week or a certain number of times per week but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if youre on track or falling behind by which i mean when i pull up my habits for thursdayy for instance and i see exercise at gym in my list of habits for that day then surely i should get some indication of youve been to the gym x times this week so far and you have y gym sessions remaining for this week in order to fulfil your habitual obligations again the information is there in the app but you have to actively seek it out maybe the more fastidious timekeepers will see to this without batting an eye but for forgetful adhdprone types like myself if its not right in front of me then it might as well not exist but all in all these are minor foibles fantastic app 55
5,really a full package app for all types of need i loved it so much
5,i have been using this for quite sometime now no nonsense app gets the job done but after oreo update i cant seem to find custom notification sound for ticktick earlier i had set a custom sound for reminder which was very useful this is the only issue for me
5,its a very good task manager app than compared to todoist with the free plan
5,its actually good it helps me with my everyday routine and most functional of all apps for to do list
5,perfect specially on laptop
5,very userfriendly the free version is good enough i like it
5,the best to do app ive used so far
5,this has to be the best gtd app out there now the free version is extensive and includes features that others charge like the most useful kanban feature with google calendar integration i finally have all meetings tasks and reminders in one place the ui is so easy and intuitive that on the day i installed it i was able to plan a webdevelopment project and assign tasks in just minutes it also has notes and white noise task level status would make it even better at managing projects
5,best app for sure for estate agents
5,best to do list ever
5,wonder full
5,really good app both when it comes to managing tasks and tracking habits it supports language input when creating tasks such as every monday it also has a few useful widgets for the home screen only bad thing about this app is that you have to pay if you want to get access to all features but its not that expensive and the app is really good even without premium so thats why it still gets five stars from me
5,the description didnt tell me that filters were premium when it listed premium features edit maybe saying something like ticktick premium features include the following and more would be more clear  thanks for the reply
5,very effective application
5,its good to organize schedule
5,please add money management also
5,great to keep you on track
5,honestly love this app i swear its made me become a more organized person and i always recommend it to people sadly i havent been sponsored yet tt lol jk but fr tho i dont usually give a review so thats how you know this app is unique i dont have premium cause im broke like that  but even without premium its pretty good i recommend
5,have used daily for 2 years now i like how its customizable and i can see events for several years ahead at a glance that native alarm is loud enough but not blaring and its great for repetitive events or tasks there are no ads
5,deserves the 5 star and support is incredible
5,honestly just an incredible app youve never seen more features or ways to organize your life in a single place i use it in conjunction with the desktop app and its quickly become my goto no ads tons of features and no bugs as far as i can see download it
5,wonderful app to keep you up to date and to remind you to complete your tasks in time
5,good features and sample interface
5,i love this app it helps a lot
5,i cant speak more highly of this app it just keeps getting better i came over from todoist several months ago and have not regretted it for a single day keep up the great work
5,great work 
5,very clean and straight forward to use
5,loving the app so far i have gone through so many to do lists from minimal to most customizable this is by far unmatched is there a way to make a due date as a week number so for instance if i want to work on a project during a certain week but im not sure which day just yet how can i add that
5,i love this app actually calender widget is very handy i been using it from past 5 monthsgive it a try youll love it definitely 
5,love the free version considering the paid version  seems pricey for an annual fee
5,awesome app the best to do app that i have used and i have used a lot its better than todoist for its coustimization even in the free version its just great
5,great app for keeping track of things you have to get done i love the feature that lets you add lists inside of folders i use mine for different subjects in school it also has a nice calendar view of your tasks and is great for setting reminders
5,very useful must have app
5,its very fruitful to get done my work as productive
5,perfect app in all kind
5,the best ive ever seen out of dozens of apps regularly makes small improvements always room for improvement but thoroughly impressed
5,very good and has all the options that you need it seems they have thought of everything i would recommend this app
5,best in class
5,so far i think its good enough but a little advice from me it would be better if the note mode added a folder feature that is we can add notes to a note hopefully it can be responded to and thank you for reading
5,the best todo list app i like it so much there are a lot of features which can help you to boost your productivity
5,luis

5,very useful for university students
5,my goto todolist app frequently updated with excellent features tags attachments comments recurring and locationaware tasks natural language input reminders habit tracking pomodoros calendar integration flexible lists kanban boards markdown support gamification elements with badges and scores and more recently subtasks for project management note system etc one of my alltime favourite apps its become an essential part of my daytoday workflow im an absolute fan 
5,clean look simple to use
5,so much better than google or microsoft similar apps a practical app that provides every thing you need even in free mode
5,the only app that effectively helps me get things done
5,awesome and easy to use app
5,like it
5,very usefull app
5,nice amazing app 
5,very useful for task management
5,awesome syncs could be faster though habits take too much time to sync and some completed tasks on the laptop sync very late sending a barrage of unnecessary notifications on the phone or vise versa amazing response time of support and dev teams
5,very nice and easy
5,thank you next
5,easy to use has really helped me organise and reach my goals i wish there was more customisation options for maybe one off payments rather than monthly for premium but even the nonpremium version is great
5,the best productivity app of all time
5,ticktick is making me more productive a writen task is done task for me
5,i am very setisfied with your work just add one new feature that has a switch on off tap to pause the remainder of any task any time for example if i make a task of yoga daily then i can turn off the task for some time and then turn it on later
5,works perfectly and suits my needs
5,voice alret only missing
5,great widget great customizability great notifications simple reminders recurring tasks and things you want to do today are all easy to schedule
5,use this professionally as a daily task manager as i have a terrible memory really helps structure my day
1,are you kidding all the cool character customization items which are very limited in the first place cost real money i thought the purpose of the app was to help people by motivating them with rewards but theres absolutely nothing interesting you can buy for your character with the regular currency what is the point then ridicilous put ads in it if anything but not lock the very few items you have available behind a currency that costs real money
1,racist app why the fff dont you have my skin color so i can be light blue and green but no caucasian oh right nowadays were supposed to be the villains of the world isnt it
1,this app doesnt have a background music which makes it not like a game at all no music doesnt make me interested at all put like a doom soundtrack or at least something 
1,recent update has so many bugs tasks and habits will be gone upon first opening the app i have to restart the app every time i want to do something save and delete buttons are the same color as the banner or gone entirely i love this game but im about to be done after this update 
1,how do i save changes to dailiesi have a ton of subtasks i curate as i hone in my routines the save confirm button is gone also the app feels so different than the last version and its a shock but thats par for the course with updates
1,it wont let me set a username just says username already taken even if i type in a random string of lettersnumbers
1,theres no button or method for saving changes or deleting tasks meaning i cant use this app at all
1,didnt feel like a game
1,well this was great until this update now its impossible to see anyting because its so small please change it back
1,cant open app after the new update
1,the reviews have great things to say but im stuck at the display name and username screen i triple checked them and they fit the requirements but it wont let me move on until i can log in this app is basically useless
1,this is maybe what radicalizes people into anchroprimitivists
1,couldnt sign up  no passwords accepted
1,tutorial suddenly stopped and i couldnt complete it
1,absolute mess of an app
1,too damned complicated to even keep up with a video game hub is more organized and simplified than this

1,opaque complicated janky overall a frustrating and confusing ap
1,its been months and i still cannot delete this one habit it will not delete and nothing ive been sent has been helpful to figure out why about ready to find a different app cause its driving me nuts
1,can somebody tell me why the heck wud this app wanna hv accesss to my gmail account
1,i have just downloaded this app and i cant register is there a reason for that
1,loads of bugs cant even register probably due to server side reliance and poor state management in the app will definitely avoid
1,i cant download it to my phone
1,y doesnt the reminder work i m trying m trying changed all my settings according to this and it doesnt work at all it doesnt remind me i tried and set a particular time and i was waiting but it didnt i m fed up really this made me more anger than ever

1,kept bugging out trying to registerlog in
1,i love it except and this is a big issue for me its totally server based want to update anything but have a bad internet connection too bad its either going to take forever or fail i would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device so back to hunting for a todo app edit 323 i have to drop my review on this to 1 star you can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that i need internet
1,it does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person nice app but useless
1,i should be able to use the app when offline and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet it shouldnt force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox
1,buggy as all hell the advertisement is right it gamifies tasks but thats it no tracking history of your habits inaccurate as all hell worst of all is you cant delete your account theyll forever keep your data im sure thats illegal in parts of this country and around the world definitely dont use your real email to sign up to test it out
1,stopped
1,cant even start it properly just says path profilename is required
1,unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in by google account or email i tried a lot from iran
1,great concept but i cant even create an avatar this is a constant bug listed in reviews the company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app but how can they when we cant even actually choose anything i guess ill try one of the competitors apps
1,this app is completely unusable on my note10 the account creation is riddled with errors and when i finally get into the app i cant click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing i was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it but the experience was downright embarrassing id love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions

1,my phone is a samsung s8 the introduction screen is mostly blank and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options dont show up i didnt go any further
1,app broken dont bother like many many other reviewers this app is totally broken and defunct on android devices and specifically galaxy s10  note 10 devices it seems the developer response to all of those reviews is please report a bug but this has now been an issue for months that they havent looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken i have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works i will not be back
1,installed it and it glitched and didnt display many of the images on the create your avatar page immediately uninstalled

1,doesnt work the main screen is stuck i can move to the next page
1,downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits but when i get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts then i cant save the username and display name i create and the avatar generator screen doesnt load any options opened the app the next day to find nothing i could edit had been saved uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results pretty disappointed
1,same issue as don smith who wrote a review on 101019 will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app inop current phone is the google pixel 4xlperhaps i misspoke in regards to the reply my issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content
1,doesnt show character customisation think it needs an update

1,so many portions of the app were not appearing on the screen from the get go including the first two screens entirely and even the avartar selections
1,busted from the start on the first open of the app i got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens then on the avatar creation screen the avatar wasnt visible when finally getting in to the app the help text bubble didnt point at anything just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue this app sounded interesting but it seems theres a complete lack of interest in quality
1,app didnt work at all was buggy from the start of my sign up where i used my google account to login
1,want to like it so far half of the set up items arent even showing up for my samsung s8 all the purple screens are blank was excited to try but it doesnt work
1,the website works but the app is blank
1,this app has some major problems it seemed to work fine for the first day of running after the first day no reminders were executed any game armor or weapons could never be equipped it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar i mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work im not certain im going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed

1,i had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun then i downloaded the update i now have nothing not even the image of an avatar theres just nothing there i have no experience no level no coins nothing i was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake there was so much i put into this game how can i remember all of the tasks i scheduled for myself i am so so discouraged
1,i couldnt register  the circle rounds and rounds  and nothing happens
1,cant even log in seems to stop working or freeze up every time just downloaded the app for the first time cant make a new account or log in waste of time will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen
1,its completely broken things dont show up error codes from the very beginning its just broken
1,as soon as i downloaded the app and made a new account i couldnt create a new character because under the body skin and other options to make your character was blank when i changed my display name i got a weird message for profilename required the randomize button didnt even work for me either i left originally because there were many bugs with todos and other things and im not confident its functional past the character creator so i dont see a point to continue on the s10e
1,i kept getting empty screens when opening the app so i pressed skip filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where i couldnt see my character or the build options i could select things like body or hair but nothing appeared relating to that
1,i really want to use this app but on my galaxy s10 the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in are blank the character visuals on the character customization are invisible and on the settings menu i scroll down and the options start to overlap each other hard to describe i will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app but currently its unusable for me
1,major issues need all email so i can send you pics pixel 2xl
1,apps been broken from the moment i download need fixing

1,update 2 okay i think i have figured it out the app doesnt sync with the servers on my wifi but works fine on my data connection weirdly enough the web version works on my laptop using the same wifi please fix update 1 reinstalled app apparently login with google is completely broken not working at all thats why maybe the data is not syncing originalno data loads upon startup just a blank screen with 0 health 0 xp and 0 mana
1,beginning setup wasnt loading at all signed up using facebook since it was not loading i just clicked next now im stuck with my avatar with no way to change
1,there seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete so i had to delete the tasks i actually did complete and therefore have not gotten ingame rewards there is also no way at all to contact support if you join the habitat help guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions there is no obvious way to post a question there there is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question this app is terrible and is a waste of time
1,after signing in i get random notifications telling me things i absolutely do not care about i havent even added any tasks and its already telling me to join groups and blah blah blah no thank you

1,ganky couldnt get it to work right
1,first thing i did when i installed the app was disable notifications and yet i still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long that aside the app is poorly made ui is very buggy chat functions are glitchy and dont update mezsages correctly sometimes the main ui responds to nothing you can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription
1,doesnt work nothing happens when signing in with google and when creating a new account it just shows server timeout
1,pretty disappointed that the first wall i hit is having to login or register i get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss the app looked promising and i was really impressed with the bit of pixel art i got to see however im not sure i want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet
1,terrible moderator community anti religious  reply ive already had numerous interactions with habatica mods and ive no desire to reply further when i questioned why the website had an antichristian stance i was banned nothing more needs to be said
1,i cannt acces my account anymore since their password reset feature does not work tried on my iphone android oreo web version i dont receive any email to reset my password
1,great app but only if it was an offline app i wouldve given it a five star please fix this
1,got banned for talking about not politically correct stuff in a respectful manner didnt even had a chance to discuss or clear my name would not recommend bc of it being heavily monitored and censored it does not facilitate what it was aiming for a community for learning and growth after pouring 2 months and money into it was terribly disappointed after my ban yes perma ban no warnings no nothing disgusting outsourcing will power is a bad idea anyways
1,seems broken  cant complete the process of creating new tasks so im just stuck with a huge empty menu i cant change loved the idea but this is broken and unusable
1,confusing and definitely didnt motivate me to do tasks just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks
1,online really register really theres two other apps in the suggestedsimilar apps banner that are better than this  theyre free to use with out registration why for this type of app  full  offline  again

1,no i dont feel like getting weapons to hurt someone
1,app worked fine till they put in the new username update now theres a bug where you cant get into the app because every name is taken
1,the big problem is that task management should work offline and habitica should have synchronization feature like anki mobile and anki pc
1,i love it at first plus the very idea gamifying a task to make it a habit it was all fun until the i cant use it offline that really threw me off please make it available offline as well
1,you have to register to play you cant even check it out to decide if its worth it
1,couldnt login
1,never really liked the features of habitica instead i do my stuff via liferpg
1,no bank and losing your life and all your gold is absolutely ridiculous after spending so much time using this app
1,stuck on username not available no matter what i put in
1,need to be online to use this app in case you make changes in offline mode it doesnt sync automatically when online you need to again make those changes enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online once this is done you got my 5 star
1,cant change class
1,i cancelled my subscription back in june of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission i would like a refund for the months between now and then and another confirmation that my subscription is cancelled

1,i downloaded this app because i thought that the game concept for todo lists would be really cool opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldnt let me log in waited another hour and it still wasnt working call me impatient but i just couldnt use an app that refused to work
1,constant connection drop outs will update review when this is fixed
1,nothing but connection error after connection error the concept is great but i cant even manage to use the service because any time i try to do anything thats all im getting
1,why do you need personal information deleted
1,ever get a phone call from a salesman whom you dont remember giving your phone number out to this is the app that does it it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it once you log in the game is a huge disappointment mypoli has everything over this
1,they banned me from the chat for saying slayer as in the band weak political correctness has gone waaay to far
1,dld to try this app out but could not get past the initial setup buttons missing labels or information lethargic loading issues and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall and keeps putting me in a wheelchair the idea behind the app has a lot of potential and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly will have to wait and see as is not functional
1,hate it
1,its not like loop habits where i know i completed my habit this day where are the statistics give me the graphics
1,more like how to gain dopamine for being organized not helpful
1,hey team can you help me to fix error my friend has invited me to his guild i receive email about that but i dont get the invitation in the app
1,this app is bullocksi downloaded it and it ran smoothly on my phone and i setup my avatar my habits and my daily task and then it just stopped working and couldnt open the app again
1,graphics are suck
1,just starting and learning how to use unable to set correct due date on tasks when i select that task has a due date todays date appears when i click that date the calendar displays allgood so far but when i select a date on the calendar and close it the due date is still today
1,administered by childish adults i criticized one thing in the app politely and they banned me immediately
1,cant even use the app it doesnt allow me to check off things
1,i really wanted to love this app it looks amazing  has so much potential however the app does not sync to your timezone my day does not reset at midnight despite what the app says when i try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone it keeps switching back to midnight so my day randomly resets usually around 6 or 7 pm sometimes the day doesnt reset for more than 24 hours  my avatar takes damage for the missed day makes it impossible to effectively use 
1,have to register
1,uninstalling took forever to load when my internet connection is just working fine on other apps
1,i cannot change the order of dailies which is frustrating since normally i would like to have them in chronological order
1,server issues please fix will change review when its fixed
1,it doesnt work worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it cant connect to the server
1,requires being online to use which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated would use if it didnt require constant network or wifi connection i live and work in rural areas  had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day
1,it blocked me for no reason when i just only joined i dislike this app
1,this seems like a fun idea and was recommended to me as especially helpful for people with adhd so i was intrigued unfortunately i have encountered a bug where when i get to the screen where i choose my screen name and username i cannot press the next button after filling out the name and username then when i exit the app and go back to it its the default character and i cannot customise itmy account
1,please make it work again the app is great but it is not working and says im not connected to the internet even though i have 2 available connections please fix it
1,uninstalled couldnt get it to register disappointed
1,boot it up a choice of login or register chose uninstall
1,need to work offline
1,was expecting it to be offline
1,actually there is a difference between the username and the display name but thanks for explaining that cannot change display name
1,updated review i have used this app for half a year against my better judgement  i have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs  little  i could easily send another twenty more but it isnt worth the time  this is simply the most bugged piece of software i have ever used  the avatars are hideous  the only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface and a clever separation of the todo list into three sections  it is missing some pretty basic todo list functionality  the game loads slowly and doesnt work without an internet connection  some of the bugs ive experienced reminders pop up on random days no matter how many times i readjust their settings constantly having trouble connecting to the servers visual bugs shows one item but you get some other item  newly equipped main weapon wont show on avatar until app restarted progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page keyboards wont go away once they pop up and the list goes on and on
1,it doesnt work
1,does not work
1,update problem fixed did you people just do another update because the app is completely screwed up it cant recognize that my phone is connected to the internet
1,needs online account you want to see our habits eh no thank you
1,i keep getting a message saying the app cant connect to the server and every time i tap on a different colour of skin or shirt it stays the same
2,cant edit or change anything
2,is not working in my device i cant open it 
2,this is what everyone should have it is the ultimate game but it has a lot of bugs i cant delete tasks i cant edit tasks that were premade by the app 23 basic features are missing ill change the rating to 5 stars once it is fixed no ill not contact your team or email them the problem it is basic and you should just fix the goddamn app
2,i like the whole idea but you have to develop the animation of characters to 3d
2,i liked doing my tasks until they kicked me out for no reason why
2,dear habitica this app is currently impossible for me to use there is no save or delete button for editing habits i checked your most recent reviews and a few others seem to have the same problem please please please fix this i will say as well that the first opening of the game feels a little jarring the editing of ones character feels clumsy and it is definitely not better to start with a randomized character give users a blank sheet and let them apply changes
2,ever since the latest update its too difficult to check off tasks it keeps accidentally opening the task item for editing so annoying
2,great app but i uninstalled it because im an offline user i wish if you can make it offline with all the functions
2,im trying to change the language but always stay in english
2,interesting concept but the reward tiers are way too steep for beginners you have to be using this app either constantly or for a long time in order to gain decent rewards uninstalling its just taking up space on my phone at this point and im not really motivated to use it
2,every 2 days it erases my goal list and my reward list for several hours then my lists reappear later
2,i love dark mode but it has become really difficult to see whether a daily sub task is checked off or not this latest update has really thrown me off
2,asking to register right away without trying out the app is poor experience
2,its good and all but i lost all my progress when i reset my phone i logged into it with my email as i did before then it flashed hello new player cmon man help me bring up my old account back
2,it wont load my todos which is an important aspect fix it please
2,yo how to turn off justin he pops up nonstop
2,might help some but isnt for me it annoyed me more than it motivates me
2,the app is so good but its completely destroyed by the fact that its online for most things as far as i know you need internet and the point is that you can use this even when its offline i hope they fix it after that it deserves all 5 stars
2,too complicated too many details
2,not for couples or friends subscription for teams to share tasks doesnt think money from their micro transactions shop is enough
2,i tried buying gems but it doesnt look like i got the gems but my balance in the google pay thing has gone down last time i throw away money on this app update the gems showed up the following day not sure if thats because i emailed them about it or just it took several hours to go through
2,the app itself is useful but they charged me three times for one subscription and will not respond to me when i email them
2,the app doesnt have any option to notify you so last i played i had difficulty forming habits
2,idk what happened but from the start app was just alright and it was very nice and i was happy that i found it but since a few hours it just stopped working when im trying to complete the task it just doesnt count the mark is appears but several seconds later it vanishes and also when im trying to complete a part of assignment it doesnt count please fix 
2,couldnt really understand the purpose of using the app its either playing games or keeping track of habits a bit confusing
2,it takes too long to be fun and sets you up for failure at the start you are asked to create a small  of tasks however the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level and a few tasks means it takes a long time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class however you could level faster if you add more tasks but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail this is not discouraged as it should be and there few goals at lower levels
2,i keep running into problematic bugs right away
2,was really really excited for this but then its glitchy i ended up with tons of duplicates of the habits which takes forever to delete cause you can only delete individually and it relies on internet so i cant use it for when im out oh well 
2,no good as other applications but good for games and one task or goal like da daily routines work
2,seems like it could be fun i just had a hard time getting into it
2,fun and helpful graphics are awesome just needs a few tweaks too easy to cheat i dont like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so its kinda anthemic maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who dont drink andor use drugs it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed todo items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress
2,make a go back button
2,excited to try it out but the app crashes whenever i try to create or edit tasks
2,was ok until i saw the mtx i guess it truely does gamify things now
2,despite various updates to fix bugs the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on android the app beyond signin still functionsbut thats it the game aspect is weak the app isnt very well designed and the tutorials tend to be broken on android as well i prefer apps like fabulous which i think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way
2,set up was glitchy i didnt get further than that its a great concept though and the art is cute
2,good app but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful theres no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store even if you cancel the app will think youre still subscribed so basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help when using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10 of the time and the devs basically said oh well we cant fix that when i mentioned it
2,i like the concept because ive been trying to gamify my free time for a while assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour and all i wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar with the possibility to keep track of a daily score with a possibly negative value its a damn shame but this aint for me i wish it was more customisable
2,i love the idea but its not working on my samsung s10e like the main screen is just purple when i first open and then the features for designing my character didnt show any options ill happily try again once bugs are worked out keep us posted
2,1520 i have tried the updates since my original post and launch speed has slightly improved main landing page loads very slowly but at least didnt crash right away again almost froze when scrolling through habits i gave it more time to load then tried going to a different section of the app  it crashed 11919 would be an awesome app if it would load painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well android 9  moto g6 play please fix  i will actually update my review
2,galaxy s10 on android 10 ftue is busted first two slides dont load you get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisibledont display please fix or mark the app as incompatible with android 10
2,not very user friendly and very less interactive
2,boring and not very effective for me the visual design is a bit of a yawn and its too hard to earn rewards without paying if it works for you great but it doesnt give me enough gratification
2,i was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription my account stopped working right whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted i did everything the helpers told me clear cache reinstall the app restart phone and nothing worked its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support
2,certain pages dont fit on screen
2,does this works on android 10 i tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems its bugging doesnt show my character from charactermaking phase reinstalled it same thing occurred hopefully you guys can help me here cheers
2,would you quit directing me to the website if i want to join a partyguild it should be done on the app it wont let me log in on the site at all why you people would choose to have it so if you use log in using google it resets and begins a whole new account without asking now i have two accounts on one email it wont even give me my password i tried resetting it several times how annoying bad design after i spent so much time on the app too all for it not to work
2,need wifidata for it i get that you can play with your friends but it would be nice if i could use it without wifi for data anyway i have a limited ammout of data and brain memory so by the time i get home after all day ive forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute only gave this an extra star because i love the 8 bit art
2,the idea is wonderful but a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression for example information is slowly updated even within the application often clicking on a menu item is ignored if you create a task without a title but with a list it will become closed for editing just delete not all things are obvious i had to read help to solve simple questions well the oldschool 8bit graphics  not everyone likes it
2,seems to have glitched out on me when i put in my username and display name it gave me an error saying path profilename required then none of the avatar customization options appeared i wasnt even able to start the third page when the app crashed reopening the app took me to the dailies tutorial and now im sure im missing something i have a samsung galaxy note 10
2,i really liked this until i realized that unfinished dailyrepeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day that makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks i need to do each week
2,why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server i cant open the app and refresh it at all
2,good ideas but not well implemented it gets tedious and boring after a while
2,i downloaded this app today but there is a problem that makes me unable to see todo listshabits etc i really want to use this app but i cant do it when i cant see the options it would be great if you fixed it so i can use it
2,two bugs right at the beginning of registration first two images didnt load on the three slides intro then when registering my info it moved to the next screen but gave a name error and i couldnt make an avatar not a good first impression just deleted my account thru the website
2,the app looks interesting but it didnt work in my device which is a samsung galaxy note9  i couldnt see the introduction and i couldnt see my character in the character creation window it kept saying path profilefile is needed i dont know how to fix it
2,good app but skills glitch out all the timefix this for 5 stars
2,super glitchy too frustrating to bother trying to use it
2,im probably too old for this couldnt find the energypatience to work out how it works and why was it preset with meditation i guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more bought a huge paper planner called trigg instead less portable but it wont crash malfunction or lost if i break my phone
2,great concept but really quite bad execution with so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access not v22 of anything surprised to learn that its been in public release for 4 years now i would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game im not usually this harsh and i hope none of the devs take this review personally but get it together needs a major qol  ux overhaul before i would consider the concept v10 complete
2,the whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 edit i would love to report the big to help however the settings menue does not work so i do not have the ability to send a report
2,i immediately encountered a problem when i began by misclicking on one of my habits theres no way to correct for that manually change the values yes but the xp and hp dont change to reflect that automatically secondly the settings page is broken on my s9 and the issue is difficult to describe the display freezes so if you scroll an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below honestly the tutorial really needs work i could go on but space constraints
2,laggiest experience ever icons were missing everywhere it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me
2,to be honest its a really good app it has everything simplicity system ui etc but seriously if this is really a productivity app it needs to have an offline mode does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list
2,it is fun but now i just level up and i dont get any notifs for unallocated stat points anymore
2,did not enjoy the layout workflows rewards explanations a for the effort
2,this app is either really good or really badbroken  there are no in betweens i love the concept and its super cute but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which is super easy to misclick on as a result ive lost or accidentally lost items as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because theres no verification for buying and no refunding and thats besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear this game needs help
2,please make it work offline
2,it would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple you will need to spend money for a decent background the avatar is pixelated and doesnt look good getting a bit bored of it now
2,very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist furthermore even if my parents didnt control my wifi and i had full access there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much also whats the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want and a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time and its not fun enough
2,downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best this was one of the worst played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out
2,good idea bad execution the first screen with the customkze character options wouldnt let me pick anything therefore i couldnt move on
2,great concept but i didnt build up coins quickly enough and didnt get any gems meaning i couldnt get anything new for my character honestly a calendar and checkmark system would give me more incentive than this
2,i really enjoyed this app but now if i delete a daily reminder i still get the notification for it which is highly annoying please fix this it distracts me from my work each time i here my notification go off for a deleted reminder
2,cant check of checklist items
2,super super buggy on my note 8  cant press anything on the character creation menu after registering  justin  the tip guy  always comes up after pressing any of the menus  super super annoying  please fix asap
2,please help relogging in after several months disuse it has asked me to enter a username and its stuck on username taken will not let me progress to the app ive tried every random letternumber combination so its definitely not taken just buggy app
2,change of days in app is a major problem i wish it would happen smoothly
2,it would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way youd expect if i say i want a task to be weekly but make it so i can complete that task any day what im trying to do is make the task flexible so i can do the weekly task whatever day of the week i feel like instead however making it available everyday turns it into a daily task which i will be punished for by not completing daily my only real solution at the moment is filling up my todo list which is really frustrating
2,lost the ability to sort to dos by tags very inconvenient i used that feature a lot
2,its slow itll be better if it works offline
2,latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every dayfrustrating to usesometimes it wont savewill just have a loading loopsome basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on monday or the date format doesnt keep track of activity data correctly  please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance was thinking of paying for a subscription but whats the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable  less temperamental
2,it got boring fast
2,i really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly i tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then i cant access it i have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working i have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained i am very dissapointed as i really like the idea of the app
2,upon using the app so far i wish that it would be accessible offline other than that the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable
2,just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse now most of the time when i tap a plus sign to increase count of something nothing happens i have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute itll update the count or not it kind of does what it wants at this point ive mostly stopped using it because of this
2,this is terribly buggy and youre better off avoiding it use the website instead if youre on your mobile device latest update doesnt update habit counters onscreen after you press any buttons all of the command is processed though app still doesnt display items that are found just another buggy update
2,interesting concept but i get a path type is required error all the time so i stopped using it
2,requires an account
2,used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it several things where off like trying to put pictures in an office doc worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app
2,it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff
2,i love the idea of this app unfortunately it is not super user friendly ive been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else and yes i have gone through the faqs i finally figured out how to hatch eggs but thats all its a pretty clunky app as a game but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things thats the only reason i havent deleted it as a gamify your life app im not convinced hopefully it improves
2,i quite like habitica but this app has some issues the biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to scheduled is supposed to sort the to do items by due date thats how it works on the website but it doesnt that makes the to do list in the app useless for me
2,needs a vpn if youre in china some questionable ui and design choices though the fundamentals work well for the most part if you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay of course and the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate one month is the same price as a month of netflix and a year is 47 a year of ms office 365 with all of its functionality is 60 let that sink in i dont understand why for relatively little this app costs so much greed i assume
2,i couldnt get past the setup strength is not valid enum value path attitude
2,two stars bc i have adhd and i really wanted it to work it isnt user friendly and i cant give it the time of day to sit and figure it out ill try again later maybe this fall
2,its completely a mess cant understand what to do and where
2,couldnt get past registrationlogin ive never used the app before but when i tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when i went to login it just kept loading forever
2,not really interesting doesnt help if you dont have a discipline already in place
2,great concept but can they hire an artist this artwork is outdated otherwise i would use this
2,too hard
2,the dailies and habits should reset everydayplease let them reset
2,can do better very complex to handle for newbies
2,some my tasks and habits dissappear there arent any in completed
2,would like to change my my class and chat is impossible to navigate a simple notification system would make it easy
2,great concept but riddled with bugs sign up was horribly difficult with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize i was trying to change my username and display names app reset at around 700 pm instead of at midnight of my time zone which i had double checked beforehand i want to like it but this is becoming downright frustrating
2,this app is closing down everytime i try to do anything but daily tasks rather frustrating
2,have been a user for years but the app is borderline unusable at this point its not saving anything and is not connecting to servers tried uninstalling and reinstalling not sure whats wrong
2,the app works great with wifi i love the feel of the app and desktop versions but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limitedno wifi i cant recommend it for that
2,bug that says path type is required everytime i try to do something i tried submittinf an error report through menu  about  report a bug but i get the same error message when i try report the bug
2,awesome app but soo many bugs
2,i like the concept but the execution needs work in my experience the app was laggy nonresponsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious
2,not userfriendly
2,incredible tool awful app id recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bugridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90 of the time
2,its been really helpful for habit building but its now bugging like crazy and crashing every time i open it so not wonderful
2,its a great idea but it just doesnt work the pages never refresh for the next day and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely i went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere the refill health prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero also the add habit button isnt there always
2,the idea behind the app is nice but it isnt userfriendly finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks
2,heres the thing i love this app and the idea behind it but for some reason its so dang glitchy pages wont always change when i scroll tasks dont refresh i often have to completely close the app help very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out
2,i wanted to use this app the concept is really good but i wont use it simply because it barely functions for starters its online only but as if that wasnt enough the sync on android is just all over the place  the app would sometimes ask have you done these things today for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 am for tasks on that day speaking of tasks i couldnt set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week per task wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them for some reason they would all sync to same weekdays i enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as i researched online this is a common problem on android and hasnt been resolved for some time so it seems i have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app
2,this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the edittingcustomizing functions of the other todolist apps out there i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deletedarchivedcompleted items be able to choose colors etc 
2,the app is awesome but it made my phone drain 30 battery per day in the background which makes it useless
2,very buggy and doesnt always show whole pages or lists
2,sadly the ui isnt adapted for the pixel 3 xl
2,lets be honest here if you need help with basic habit management you wont use this regularly enough to help and if youre organized and have a good routine you dont need it a pointless novelty at best
2,clunky and very slow to load not fun at all  just yet another task i had to deal with daily
2,several navigation options are inaccessible because theyre underneath the homebacktasks buttons at the bottom or within the notificationnotch area at the top making this app hard to use on my phone
2,the app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies going back to using just the website now until this is fixed
2,this app is a great idea with poor execution reminders only sometimes appear and the ui can be very unresponsive  ive checked daily tasks off only to find that the app interpreted this as unchecking the task since it hadnt registered the fact that it is a new day yet which actually subtracts the game resources from you these problems are significant enough to make the rpglike rewards system ineffective for me and the app not worth using as a habittracker at this time sadly
2,im a breath away from uninstalling this app again half the time it doesnt even do what its supposed to do some things it doesnt even let you do inside the app you have to go to the actual browser version to do it on that subject the mobile browser is beyond awkward no chance of navigating it properly if im supposed to log into an actual pc just to check off that i did a workout or washed dishes forget it right now the only reward i get is having my good mood ruined certainly not worth it
2,good concept but lack basic functionality
2,the app itself is quite good but without offline mode its useless for me
2,no landscape mode for tablets i like the browser version but landscape support is essential to me
2,this app would be so much better if it didnt penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row instead of getting more experience coins you get less the longer you do something you should be rewarding the habits that people are building not telling them that once they have the habit theyre going to get less for it otherwise this app would get five stars for me
2,its a good app but it doesnt really work for me please provide an offline mode because not everyone has data and wifi throughout the whole day i will rate it 5 stars once there is an offline mode
2,its a great app really nice features does everything it says on the tin but let me tell you a productivity app wont do what its meant to do unless its usable offline i really loved using it but now im going back to the good old bullet journal
2,i honestly didnt get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often such as the days of the week you do each task was confusing i would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them over all too much work for its worth loved the idea though it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items
2,doesnt connect at all pls fix it
2,this app seemed very interesting until i got into the app and at the very start of it it made itself very clear that this app is geared towards women the avatar customization part all the hair and accessories were for women app seemed cool but unwelcoming for guys
2,the apps concept is very misleading i was promised gameplay and if it really is in here im having a rough time finding it
2,its a great idea and i think id really love it but its unusable offline and as someone who doesnt have access to wifi all the time that makes it impossible to work with
2,"google login does not work for me in freshly instead app i can tap login 
with google button popup asks me to pick a google account to use ipick 
the only one and im left on an empty login register screen really 
tapping google login button does nothing ive tried  manually enabling 
phone and storage permissions  manually clearing app data and cache  
reinstalling the app nothing worked"
2,"thought it was great until i opened the app to mark off a task only to 
find that i had died lost all my progress no idea how what is the point 
of having an app that gives you experience when you accomplish goals if you 
can lose it all without knowing why"
2,"after the update the widget is not working and it is draining the battery 
from my phone and my tablet redmi note 4 mtk and galaxy tab s3 will 
reinstall when those are fixed"
2,too slow and clunky especially with signup
2,too ugly to be attracted to
2,"nice idea but nothing was really working for me party not showing 
members errors connecting not worthy the annoyance"
2,i couldnt get passed avatar creation due to the app crashing
2,doesnt work
2,"excellent idea but poor execution there really isnt much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall i 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start theres 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying with so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay with no options to try before you buy 
gives me little motivation to come back some advice make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper 200 coins takes forever to grind and theres not 
much to do otherwise  have a way for f2p players to earn crystals maybe 
through daily login bonuses level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks i 
shouldnt need the internet to check off my to do list have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever theyd like having to wait until youre level 10 is too much of a 
grind have a little more customization available from the start maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay wallseven the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals  that just screams greedy"
2,"a fine app except for all the bugs any cosmetic aspirations you were 
hoping to have as a motivator character customization equipment colors 
and more all do not display not only that but an error message pops up 
every time i perform an action really hope they patch the bugs i dare not 
use anything else than the checklist"
2,"i really used to love this app but mobile push notifications stopped 
working theres been a ton of bugs lately and its just not motivating 
like it used to be when i reported the bugs i was told to email someone 
instead and im at a point where i just uninstalled  maybe ill return 
in a year or so"
2,"samsung note8 was unable to get past the what tasks would you like to work 
on screen the next screen selection was blocked out no matter was 
selected or un selected however the back button still worked"
2,"its a gamified checklist which is a good start but ultimately not enough 
to follow through on the core idea theres no actual game here nothing to 
do and no true incentive to keep you coming back an upsetting amount of 
content is gated behind purchases and i found my interest waning once i ran 
out of things to look forward to also the fact that it takes until level 
10 to be allowed to switch classes is insane"
2,"honestly its kind of dull compared to the web version you should add 
more colors because the current interface is kind of bland i cheat with 
the mobile version but stay focused on the web needs some more effort and 
work being done the greatest thing about this is the parties and i love 
that you can use accounts but the android platform seems a bit inferior to 
the web version still like it  though has some opportunity edit 
horrible on android trash absolutely trash great on web incompetent on 
mobile"
2,"unfortunately i keep getting connection errors other apps are connecting 
fine i like the app but its useless in the nonworking state on my phone 
right now"
2,i was able to set up my account just fine but i apparently made the mistake of resetting the tutorial to better understand the ui i kept getting the same welcome heres what you can do with the app tutorial eventually it started to hang so i got fed up and uninstalled the ui looks nice but that doesnt mean its usable i had a hard time figuring out the differences between the different areas to set up things you want to improve on the terminology isnt understandable no clue as to what separates habits from dailies from tasks and unfortunately because i still couldnt understand what i was supposed to do and where its not very usable for me the bug that left me in tutorialhanging hell was enough i had it installed got a grand total of 10 minutes and i dont have the patience to wait out however long itll take the developer to fix it  phone google pixel latest version of android as of 17 march
2,too casual cannot create routines for specific days only app assumes that every day is exactly the same stats are random and dont represent actual skills i prefer life rpg  time time  pomodoro app
2,i really really want to like this app  i can get as far as setting up and tracking tasks which is awesome but as soon as i try to form a party and battle monsters it runs up against some issue with google authentication i think and i cant go any farther i even tried to delete my account and start over but when you get to the step were it says type delete in all caps there is no keyboard or place to type   so yeah great concept but it has some fatal bugs
2,please hire some competent android developers throwing up cant connect to the server messages 6 times in a row when i switch networks is just pathetic
2,i seriously dont understand the basic functions of the app are so janky and broken in the avatar creation i had to keep pressing the options i wanted over and over for it to actually work then when i finished the avatar had options i didnt pick every habit defaults to being both positive and negative i know there has to be some default but its kind of weird that if i have a positive habit i have to tap the negative button adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter i guess it works but its unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself but when i add them they dont immediately get added they disappear and then get added a few minutes later half the time it wont let me move around the tasks sometimes the faq text pops up overlaying whatever screen im on switching between habits dailies todos and rewards is finicky sometimes swiping doesnt work sometimes trading the icon doesnt work i have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work same for the avatar menu with patience all this stuff does eventually work but its tedious to just use the app the app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus
2,glitches abound inputs ignored not given options to make habits at points
2,it honestly saddens me to write this review habitica used to be an amazing app i need it for all of my dailies and todos but ever since the code was migrated the app has been nigh unusable at the moment i cant even login when i finally manage to my dailies and todos dont show up its a struggle to mark a daily as completed because it takes forever for the server to recognize that i tapped on the daily overall this app needs to be reworked i really hope things can be fixed because i want to keep using this app otherwise ill have to find something else
2,fix the thing idk is that a bug of anything else i hardly click the next button or text and its look like nothings loading makes me wait and think is it loading or not then i restart the app but it became worse my character not loaded and the button became harder to click 
2,aeesome concept but very buggy and laggy wont register my taps in some places it skipped my tutorial because it wouldnt register my taps to continue
2,not a good start the ideas are sound and ive gone in with hopes but i ran into issue after issue right at the start cant get glasses to select cant add my beard or moustache without gems cant even party with my wife because of redirect errors i like this idea a lot and my wife adores this if these get fixed ill edit and bump up the rating
2,great idea riddled with bugs i cant use the app at all without an data connection which is annoying because theres no internet related interface that ive seen so far i have notifications set up that work maybe twice a week i really want to use this app but the bugs make it hard
2,habitica is great on browser and indeed has helped me tons to manage my routines but the app itself doesnt function properly now i cant even scroll down the pages to pick dailies that are further down or habits sometimes a newly hatched pet wont appear and neither will food and it doesnt tell how much damage im doing to a boss and the browser version has some bugs too sometimes logging in it will display in pt despite being set to english i assume its my browsers settings but the pages options should prevail over and synching will sometimes take gold health or mana away randomly still kicks the apps ass in every way
2,the bugs are annoying and keep it from being a better app update still has way too many bugs that never get fixed downgrading from 3 to 2 stars
2,its pretty good i really like the concept the app itself and the web app is super buggy so hard to invite friends to parties and the web app is really slow otherwise its a great game  edit app got even buggier sync is slow and pressing on habits doesnt work sometimes web app is better  update the app is still horrible but ive stuck to it because of the mechanics ive been keeping up with my habits but i really wish theyd fixed the mobile app
2,couldnt get buttons to function in the beginning couldnt you even start or set up anything besides the avatar
2,amazing idea however the programming is just not good its very slow and buggy and just makes the whole thing completely unenjoyable its ashame to see that performance issues have not been fixed over so mamy years of this being out if these issues get fixed id easily give it a 5
2,the idea is great but the design is cumbersome and counter intuitive i bought gems but was unable to set up challenges due to a bug in the app
2,went for this because of the graficzne theme found it boring  uninstalled
2,wish sync was fixed it takes a lot of manual refreshing to do basic tasks such as refresh for the day or reload when youve died ui could be better too i wish there was slightly more focus on the social side of it also slow unresponsive and unreliable really good idea but not great execution going to move on to a different app now after all this time
2,difficult to use
2,yeah too many bugs
2,the idea is great ive tried so many habit tracker apps and this one is one of the best but i hate that it doesnt work offline
2,this app has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out the ios version is a lot better
2,way overcomplicated dailies dont turn red if you miss them i dont know how often you are supposed to perform habits sync is bad there is no local application statemodel and network glitches are disastrous however graphics are cute
2,i keep tapping and its just unresponsive it seems like a fun app but to keep tapping and not getting anywhere is annoying it just stops please fix seems like a fun app to try out
2,i love habitica and have used it for years but this app has a pretty bad ui and is full of bugs disappointing
2,doesnt work on moto x pure far too slow to handle it i think seemed like a good idea but i cant access the features to make it workable
2,i used to swear by habitica for a long time but frankly i find it almost unusable the biggest most important problem is the way sync works you cant use habitica if offline or have bad internet connection you cant click several buttons in quick succession and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server android widgets are absolutely unusable habiticas manual frames it as if its not their but users fault  i have more than a dozen of habits and about the same amount of dailies most of which are themselves checklists i keep track of multiple habits therefore i open habitica and press  and  many times a day sometimes several times in an hour if every time i try to register a habit or a daily i must worry about habitica not syncing properly then it robs me of time and mental energy which makes it useless for actually instilling habits
2,the ux is horribly clunky and it takes more than two clicks just to do anything coming from todoist to this is like a bird flying into tar pit all the habit and time management improving features are sort of stuck behind the horrible ui why do i need to see soooo many boxes and options when i just want to and a single todo further more why does it take 2 taps just to get to that screen in the first place if im on the todo tab i probably want to add a todo i honestly havent seen an app this bad in years
2,this app works awfully its a great idea but it needs tons of improvements connection improvements offline actions like completing a daily which can be checked later etc  i need the paying buttons to work i cant buy 4 gems seriously do you want to get ever paid do something with this thing again its a great idea but thats the only reason why i keep using it besides that its a complete mess
2,i really want to love this but its just so buggy id happily pay money for a working version of this app but not in its current state
2,cool idea lousy execution for one the app is horribly unresponsive i also encountered bugs all over and a crash within 5 or 10 minutes of using and figuring out the app
2,great concept but i just cant do quests
2,the app is soooooooo laggy  always pop up and say no internet connection  and fail to sync  loved and used the web for a awhile but the app meh
2,this app is not working without internet connection its unacceptable for the task manager
2,this is a good idea but not so well executed the app itself is buggy text lags buttons are unresponsive and resetting the tutorial makes it repeat every single time you open one of the tabs first impression were so poor that i dont want to use this app to help my tasks and habits
2,where do i add a new habit not a daily not a todo
2,the app used to be great until the update some time ago now it consistently crashes on my phone and very very rarely loads correctly if at all on my pc
2,there are too much connection errors and bugs and they are really annoying please fix it
2,i was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits dailies todo after a few days and several rookie mistakes that arent explained well in the tutorial i realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use i want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday to encourage reading and writing every now and then not everyday this app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday i totally didnt realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone i then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off i can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task but it shouldnt be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies must complete everyday or bonus if completed they also do not make it easy to provide feedback all the discussion links either required creating a separate account different from the habatica account or were closed threads this app could be so fun but i feel it loses sight of promoting good habitsorganization i love gaming but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me would keep using this app if i could keep the lists alone
2,its absolutely fine but can be a bit laggytemperamental
2,im so disappointed here ive read other reviews talk about the site being much better but here is the reality of that a majority of internet users dont use full browsers to surf it so this app had to be good because your habits are a private and important thing and its absolutely not good the last but not only straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place and wont clear inviting people to your party was way too confusing until i found out it didnt even work until i did it manually on the site theres more but i wont bother i know its supposed to be open source but is any testing happening i was trying to be an advocate for this and you guys just killed it for me with this bad app
2,really buggy right now theres no way to create a party on the app and i cant even join one the website cant seem to log me in and if i click on any of the links on the faq page it takes me back to the homepage also tasks are listed in the order which i put them and not in the order that they expire so i have to check each task for the date and time of expiry not only that the dates are displayed weirdly some have ddmmyy format while others have mmddyy developers have much work to do
2,i wouldnt have given such a low rate if it wasnt for my honest disappointment and i promise to change to 5 starts the moment im reassured that things got better this concept is amazing and the idea is just brilliant however this is by far the buggiest app ive ever had on my android and the ui is just not well thought of guys please work on the bugs so i wont have to click 1000 times before i get feedback that something happened wont have to reopen the app and lose all the initial welcome tour with all the choices wont have to use my full name without being able to change it because i signed up with google these things seem basic to me i really hope it will get better this app could be a life changer
2,i ended up giving up on this app a few years back i used it frequently and now recently i came back but its just incredibly frustrating how it always returns server or internet errors and doesnt save my changes its a real pity because it was a very fun app to use
3,i love the layout structure and simplicity of this app but it has one critical failure there is no way to view stats except how many times you have done a thing make the bed 23 times in what timeframe a month a year what is the percentage of days it has been madenot made the only thing i feel like i have to show for this is virtual items if you would add satisfaction with good stats i would rate 55 kindest regards william
3,i hate to give this app 3 stars because i love habitica but while the website is fine the app has some problems 1 i couldnt find a way to turn off push notifications from new messages in your partys chat this would be very useful to users in large parties 2 i couldnt find a way to sort backgrounds by what i own i dont want to have to scroll all the way down looking for my old ones 3 i couldnt find a way to delete only some of the tasks from a broken challenge
3,i love the concept a lot but the actual gaming aspect of it leaves a lot to be desired if there was something we could do or level up to or actually fight maybe pokemon sort of format for the game that would really make it better and keep someone interested
3,overall a solid app but there are some cash cow mechanisms
3,good idea of gamification but in my opinion many of its bells and whistles are distracting
3,missing the integration with egcalendar u have to fill in too many forms and manage it all by yourself
3,cant remove habits
3,i would love to play this game if you added an aspect of battle against other real life characters that would be motivating to get all the areas up and not just work on one area 
3,great app a few bugs here and there everything ive ever checked off occasionally shows up in the to do list so thats weird currently i cant check off anything from my to dos and dailies its a bit frustrating
3,the app seems great and i had a really positive impression to it though i wish that its functionality also works fully and properly when you are not connected to the internet that one was the bummer as to why i rated it low sorry its just im more of an offline person and i want the apps that i install like yours are available offline given its features and functionalities i hope that you consider my concern
3,the latest update has shrunk the buttons and i can no longer use this app to check off my dailies
3,its a great concept but i wish it had more engaging gameplay wherein we could actually fight bosses dungeons etc without that those upgrades seem useless hope you try adding such a feature
3,it would be so much better if you could walk around in the game and build stuff and talk to npcs like add a animal crossingminecraft aspect to it that would be a whole lot more fun
3,didnt work out for me
3,this app is amazing it has a very user friendly interface id say its great for developing habits making short daily task list but the only downside is there is no calendar view so i cant plan ahead and time things for the long run thats why im giving it 3 stars
3,"the idea is wonderful truly but problems exist
1 bugs todo list and dailies keep being empty refreshing doesnt work only close and reopen app
2 monthly subscription seems highly excessive  i dont like paying for a service that remains static this could and should imo be an offline app particularly with the existing obvious bugs payment is out of the question right now
3 tutorial is lacking i had to figure a few things out by myself as a first time user"
3,waiting for offline mode
3,its an alright app just havent been able to really do much with it anymore
3,as much as i have loved using the app i ultimately used more of my time focusing on adapting to the app and using it for an extra boost of instant gratification it would also crash often on my tablet its a great idea but it doesnt suit me that well
3,too hard to get started i didnt use it
3,plz plz plz plz make it offline guys
3,the experience was very good the only down side is the lack of offline capabilities
3,first day of the week setting doesnt work when the calendar pops up it shows sunday as the first day of the week rather than monday  i have selected monday in the settings please fix this
3,i didnt get it but i dont know im the demographic it was made for
3,great idea but i liked this concept and could see how it could definitely help but some bugs to be worked out and in some place over complicated main issue for me was the reminders didnt work on android galaxy s8 which made this unusable also struggled to understand the difference between habits and dailies
3,good design and easy to use i dont like the avatars but thats just a preference for some reason i cant delete some tasks and it makes it feel cluttered great for someone with adhdadd or anyone who generally needs reminding on tasks that others may not
3,nice app although the first sentence of the description of the app isnt nice life shouldnt be treated like a game
3,app is good but i dont have audio using it how can i fix this will rate 5 star if audio will be fixed
3,great app good concept needs refining i found the change values area and within 5 minutes i owned every item in the game i have no idea how to use the actual game functions in this app as said before its a good concept but needs refining
3,edit june 5 2020 fix the party chat please it is very annoying having to switch to other categories just to see the new message even the private messages are the same way
3,make it offline then it will best appp
3,app is cool on the surface but has some things that could be improved on for example some things just arent finished or stop working in a couple customization menus there isnt an option to take off accessories while that option is available in others menus suddenly stop working and you have to close and reload the app to fix it there is no in depth tutorial and a lot of stuff is up to you to figure out which can be confusing because the user interface isnt always clear
3,terrible ui
3,ugly graphics i wish it measured my walking distance like pokemon go
3,it is a good app but there is too much information especially regarding the social part its just not the kind of app for me
3,in the widgets you can have many dailies and tasks but for habit you can add only 1 habit please look into it
3,love the app but it crashes a lot on my phone and my husbands also the alerts are repetitive and cannot be dismissed
3,its not like the web site
3,can i use it offline
3,it is a pretty good concept its just not for me
3,this app seems great ive seen other apps gamifying your life but what i feels really works is that you can make a party of friends and get productive together while clearing dungeons and getting loot if you make a group of friends be aware that even if its just your friends in the group a single swearword will get you banned not a warning or anything straight up banned i got banned because i called my close friend a fword cword mind you not in public but in our little group where that sort of banther is normal between us mind you id never talk to anyone like that in a public group i dont mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation where there was no victims but its not within my power to change the community guidelines hopefully ill get unbanned so i can give the app a swing it does seem great only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer will definetly change stars for the better if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys maybe add a report button instead
3,i cant delete tasks from the old challenge anymore
3,great concept but theres issues with the widget it shows nothing
3,this is fun and cool it would be 5 stars but you know what habitica we die so quickly we litterally log in me and my party and we are dead because someone didnt log in that day also there should not be boss dealing damage it deals more damage then i deal to it the healers heal 6 health out of 50 and use 25 mana points my teamate just used all of their mana to try and keep alive and i do then i check off my dailies from yesterday and i died and i dealt 11 boss dealt 14 pls fix team agrees fix
3,good app was finding it useful but its not made clear how you join the guilds or when your reg for a challenge has been ac epted no space to write diary so how do you know people actually were if there was a section for diary overall i found the app very confusing
3,this app seems to make me want to procrastinate more
3,this app has a fantastic concept that being an mmo style game based around your success in real life the game is entirely server based and i have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect i would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game so because of the insane amount of server issues i have experienced just using the app for a little but i could not recommend this which is a shame
3,graphics are too bad please change it as a gamer we need very good graphics and it should have sound and sfx etc example  like the game pocket morties 
3,i need help party and guild is buggy for me only a blank page is displayed if i open that pls fix this
3,seems like i really great app but i just installed it and i couldnt get passed the avatar creation screen 
3,my friend loves this app but its not for me
3,im constantly finding little glitches in the game that throw off what i am trying to do when i am trying to earn points thank goodness for husband and siblings who have played this enough to know how to fix things when they go buggy but i dont appreciate not being able to go to customer service or send a quick email to help them update the system and fix it
3,ive been using habitica for a few years now and while i love the idea from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken it feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing the most annoying bugs are party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so youre not sure if you accepted it spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating have to restart the app to see new messages
3,just downloaded the app better review later on
3,looks promising but i cant create avatar due to this error path profile name is required
3,ok i like it but know what the experience points keep expanding but not with health simultaneously you will be sent backward everytime you lose your health while to refill health you need to max up the exp point please fix this
3,is there any ways to see your progress in graphic like daily task youve done and see it in graphic stats or something because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something i wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily the ui and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev
3,its fun a great concept but the app itself needs work it locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then restarted and the reminders basically dont work at all honestly i think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking youll get a needed reminder when you wont because it doesnt actually work
3,i like the app and its a pity that i wont keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which i need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes
3,game is great can give back results where you put in effort however when i last tried to put in a task everything was empty and i cant seem to log back in
3,the game is very buggy i just bought a reward then the app crashed and the gold ive spent is gone but i didnt receive the reward these kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously and it could be such a good game otherwise
3,love the idea but the app is so buggy and not too user friendly at points first off i cant change my character when creating an account because nothing pops up its just missing so i end up with a female characters i have galaxys10 and tried reinstalling app but nope seems to be just a bug also changing outfits just seems terrible to scroll through the not user friendly part the good idea is amazing i really want this app to improve so i can incorporate this into my daily life
3,this is a good app to motivate but wished there would be analytics to show progress like graphs etc
3,looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone i cant stand any app thats mostly bright b white went with liferpg instead
3,love the app love the rewards but i wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous and i wish that the coloring of tasks wasnt so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever also certain things are hard to navigate but overall i absolutely love this app use it every day not so much for challenges or battles but for habit making and to dos
3,i really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs the first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too after updating the app it was still the same im using a samsung s8 if thats important hope you guys fix it cuz id love to use the app
3,the concept is inventive but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use
3,app has been useful in helping me keep track of tasks and all but lately the alarms i set on my dailies havent been going off at all which is unfortunate because theyre all to remind me to eat
3,first two slides doesnt load the character in character creation  menu items are invisible pls fix
3,it doesnt work offline and when im actually online i need also a vpn to use it 
3,the to do list should allow prioritizing tasks by importance and urgency it would be great if you could add that
3,had a great experience when i was using it thru browser but when i installed it on my phone it wouldnt record all my progress and tasks on my phone application even with the same account please work it out i would love to keep using thru my phone
3,i really like this however im not able to stay with it for long periods of time this one and others ive tried and i just cant stay motivated
3,i liked but in my cellphone had some bugs galaxy a8 i think if this app had a function to sync with the phone calendar google calendar or samsung calendar it would be much better
3,it seems so cool and i wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in it takes 1second to load and then nothing happens
3,cute but seems like it would benefit from a way to set eg monthly or annual reminders for bills and birthdays without going to a google script
3,its a cool app and it kinda helps me but you are forced to be a warrior it says you can change your class in the settings but there is no option
3,friend was permabanned for calling another friend a mad ct in party chat but here in australia thats a compliment tldr oversensitive language filter should allow party chat to be unfiltered
3,it needs a better way to schedule the to do list an easy way to schedule your day week and even month it needs a calendar to see things with a bird eye view i like the game thing but it needs more functions and to be more practical
3,app is amazing but ios version is so much better than android version it has many other settings while this one lacks them i hope this gets fixed so i can change my rate to 5 stars
3,não consigo mudar a linguagem já fui nas opções e tudo mas sempre atualiza e fica no inglês
3,okay but i wish it had options to increase exp and stays for example when you read a book gain x intuition when you run x times you gain x stamina etc etc and get rewards and level that way gives more motivation for doing those things
3,disappointed had the app installed for a few weeks only i was enjoying it and improving my life and suddenly it stopped working i keep getting notifications saying that theres no connection i cant log anything and once i decided to reinstall again and again i cant even log in anymore the screen wont load and it never goes past the loginregister screen
3,all my tasks are gone and unable to load anything
3,the concept is great and its a fun way to keep track of your habits my only gripes are i wish there was a better way to see habit streaks the number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view i think that would be helpful you could miss a day and if streaks arent set to reset the number remains unchanged better explanation of the colors on streaks i still dont know what they mean going to google it you cant use rogue skills because you get a blue screen
3,ребят конечно круто что вы сделали это в виде игры только вот вы бы могли доработать такие вещи  сбивается сортировка задач после выхода из приложения я хочу чтобы у меня постоянно была сортировка по не выполненим ежедневным задачам  я закрыла прогу на вкладке ежедневные задачи  хочу чтобы при повторном открытии она была также на этой вкладке
3,neat concept just not for me
3,why it is not giving me notifications for dailies
3,fantastic idea ive actively been seeking something just like this for a long time but the app itself is super glitchy most things wont load and everything keeps resetting it might be my connection or my phone im not sure hoping i can figure it out cause i love this
3,please make offline version because most of studious people cannot afford online apps so if you want good ratting please make part 2 offline
3,i like this app but this is the buggiest app i ever had i been using this for years and still havent fix them
3,great idea it needs some improvements imo edit after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items you shouldnt have to refresh to see them that also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh etc
3,enjoying the app so far but the widgets are quite limiting you cannot use check lists in the widgets and sometimes they update rather weirdly i have also had ui bugs throughout but they havent affected me too much overall good but just needs some tweaking to make it more solid thats not to say the service is bad just the mobile app
3,love this app its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating ive been more motivated since using it but im having a very frustrating issue that is driving my ocd insane i try to move a task in my list only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere i didnt tell it to go i try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all
3,i love it but the app keeps crashing when i try to invite friends to party and i cant buy gems
3,force closes when trying to create challenge
3,ive been actively using this and i love the concept app version could really use a new ui dark mode would be appreciated and maybe letting users adjust font or size of boxes feels too large right now it would easily hold more details but space is lost to a big box
3,it miss my data after updatingi cant use it easily
3,decent app fun concept biggest issue right now is that some of the dailies that are supposed to be once per week are still showing up as an everyday task which is very annoying sometimes the dailies will cross over into the todo list for an hour or so at a time too
3,the app is great except for being internet dependant and lacking an undo button or a button lock for unintended log entries i know there is an edit your character section but there is no record of past entries to use as reference
3,its a very good game and i like it but to buy most things in the game you have to get gems or a subscription which you both to pay for also i dont seem to get anything when i purchase the enchanted armoire
3,it is a great idea dont get me wrong but why the need for a chat room
3,over the years the platform has become stagnant i was a huge proponent of habitica using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development but development beyond bug fixes never happened its a good tool with a potent gamification component but theyve failed to continue to make it engaging and interestingand certainly not worth paying to support
3,miss the dark theme
3,gamification is good designed but the app works kind of laggy 5 star when redesigned
3,the app is what you expect
3,having some equipment related bugs
3,parece una gran app pero no se me actualiza el idioma a español a pesar de que ya lo configure para que asi sea una lastima
3,nice and useful app feels quite buggy though and the party chat goes the wrong way if youre used to any other chat app
3,too complex as a game the time i spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working
3,i love habitica and i like the ui of the updated app but i find it frustrating that the app doesnt show all the content that the website does normally this is just a small annoyancebut now after paying for a group plan for my family im discovering that my kids cant access the group tasks list via the app which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores please tell me a fix is in the works
3,ive just installed this as and wont be using it due to it requiring you to create an account and login it sounds like a fantastic app but id much rather my data was stored locally where only i have access to it
3,useless as you can not group habits but gamifying idea is good maybe they will fix it
3,good idea but this isnt for me i am much more for classic habit apps
3,i really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesnt work offline so i cant use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features
3,i really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened i have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app
3,id love to see class selection as an option when you start the game i was forced to be warrior without an option to change i even went to setting and nothing there to change it either
3,the app is pretty good but i wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in i tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but i still lost health for not completing it daily it would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you dont do every day but repeat on a schedule like laundry every sunday or something
3,i love this app but the latest update is buggy and does not record when i check off tasks please fix
3,a great app has some kinks that need ironing and ill update when theyre done but i love this app and use it daily  as intended 
3,this app has done a good job of helping me keep track of tasks dailies habits and the to do with checklists have been wonderful i just dont like the new redesign nothing looks to be where it should be to me it now feels bulky and clunky and i feel like it will make me use it a lot less because it is now uncomfortable to look at
3,idea is cool not for everyone im removing 1 star for not having any charts for the habits themselves and 1 star for the funky behavior of tasks screen  id edit some task from dailies and after its saved im placed back to habits for example
3,finally is working but i had to erase the data on my cellphone  later im going to check what happened with the avatar until then the rating gonna stay still
3,why doesnt adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience say if i accidentally clicked  or  for a habit
3,bug message cannot be displayed on app android 9 nokia 61 plus
3,idk if its my phone android but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app 
3,interesting and promising but not refined or intuitive chat function is one of the worst ive ever encountered
3,love the app but i have a question in the options under daily tasks we can choose between daily or weekly whats the difference
3,missing a few good features and isnt always the most stable of apps
3,the website is buggy but enjoyable the app however feel almost nonfunctional
3,fix the glitch where if you want to change the streak of a daily the keyboard pops up and gos down super annoying
3,the big cons to this app dailies tab always shows all of my weekly duties instead of the daily ones i change this in the filter but once i reopen the app it switches back to showing everything whats the point of a filter when the app doesnt save it galaxy note 8 also why is there no dark mode my eyes are screaming at night
3,i have been using this app for a while really trying to get to grips with it but ive come to conclude that its not me if you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isnt for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky i think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks habits and dailies
3,edit reverted to old version or something and issues are back  edit issue fixed and new update is great seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email huge fan of habitica used it for years it was called habitrpg when i started only todo list app i have stuck to encourages you to build good habits in a fun way communitybuilt no adsworth subscribing to support the app
3,fun way to track habits it would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers
3,this app is very helpful total game changer for my adhd unfortunately after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped but overall im happy this app exists it really helps me stay on track  perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldnt need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app i feel as though many people will quit once the rpg element is restricted
3,having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying its really boring otherwise reminders dont work properly  i set a bunch for last night that never happened and a bunch this morning that never happened its not really built for proper daily routines including things you need to do twice per day so its not really useful for me
3,incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it the app tends to be buggy but nothing that couldnt easily be worked around until the last update since the last update drag and drop sorting of to do and i suspect dailies as well subtaskschecklists no longer works which is really frustrating at least the website works great as always its just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists
3,latest update is super buggy cant change if i want my dailys to be every 2 days 3 days etc because the keyboard jumps up and immediately disappears really annoying
3,loving it but are there themes on the horizon not a huge fan on purple and where can see a weeklymonthly summary of how im keeping up with my dailies also i noticed a bug when i accidentally hit create multiple times for a new daily it will create multiple instances of it
3,nice but not what i need for now
3,it has great promise but i cant use it offline so its worthless to me
3,cool concept but i dont have the attention span for it
3,very good app but i wish it can be used offline 
3,wants me to write a username but says username already taken even when i put nonsense in
3,i dont get the point of the game
3,clunky annoying lag time after button presses often wont update upon opening
3,timezone feature broken the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs
3,im giving it 3 stars it deserves 5 stars for the app but getting 3 cause after i bought some gems there were some shady withdrawals which means the privacy protection for my card was breached and im 99 sure its from habitica cause this happened right after the purchase please increase your cyber security for card transactions
4,i love habitica so far with the exception that no one is able to get my party invitations it would also be great if party members could trade pets
4,the graphics are adorable and the ui is clean there were a few things that were a little confusing to find but theres a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the faq the only reason it doesnt work for me is because tasks feel more like currency than progression other task rpg apps either chart your progress or show it as a literal path which feels more like moving forward cute app but more for those who like armor building in mmos
4,it works but it has issues the thing is compared to some other apps of its kind its not great it could use some more customization like custom items and the tutorial is kinda annoying especially with pre made tasks but it does what it says and well enough edit thanks to the habitica team for responding some developers dont care but its good to know this app has a great community
4,please add the option to view progress monthly  year  week
4,just change the colour of deletesave button in dark theme and ill recommend this app to everyone i know
4,great looks and concept has some important features for accountability that other apps dont task scheduling not as good as the competition tutorial needs to be more explanatory
4,just installed yesterday and have used it for a whole day the app is very helpful is setting concrete habits to reinforce or discourage and comes in the familiar set up of a video game id definitely recommend this to others who are trying to develop themselves one minor issue is that in some dark app themes the delete and save button cant be seen because the text and background have the same color other than that the app works fine
4,its fun
4,i would really like it if there was an option to have rewarding sounds when completing checklist items in dailies and to dos thanks to the amazing team at habitica you rock 
4,i love those platform but the recent update is buggy
4,its a cool app but i wished there was a way to know how much you have improved week by week or a similar record it doesnt really push you to improve just to do something if you do less than before its ok you just advance slower and you keep going slow it would motivate me more to try and do better than the last day or the last week but i wouldnt know how that was unless i took a screenshot 
4,great app and service the user base is amazing and the staff is awesome no notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks cant read the full text of challenge tasks before joining most notifications dont work for me the redesign looks really nice
4,really good for motivating me to do certain tasks i do wish that todo list items turned red slower as the number of subtasks under it increased but thats just me edit feedback form isnt there
4,i love the new dark mode i use dark mode for everything so this is much appreciated the design has been streamlined and its easy to use i do check off all my tasks in one go so the rewards popup blocking the last item on the list is a little annoying but workable just gotta wait a second for it to go away
4,this is the first of these gamified taskhabit trackers ive tried that i liked enough to stick with a bit buggy but enjoyable enough to make up for it update the app has a dark mode now too
4,it it great but i am using habit now i like to know the stats of my habits as that app shows no hard feelings only personal preference
4,its really good really helpful please put a goal feature
4,i love thats application but l will to be in spanish version i love thats application but l will be like to be in spanish version
4,super bueno salvo porque estar en la app diciendo que hiciste y que no te resta tiempo de tareas que debes hacer
4,excellenct love it but there is one thing habitica desperately needs a vision  goal setter means a function to set a specific goal or describe a vision and add tasks  todos  habits specifially for this goal it might even be a main tab at the bottom of the menu habitica cant just only do repetitive tasks there ought to be goals too please implement this
4,i really enjoy the app and it helps in keeping up with the goals congrats to the team habitica for this creation im rating it 4 because there are still bugs exists and im not satisfied with the idea of only team leader can end a quest in order to for someone to leave the party i was invited to a party by a friend and then he stopped using it when we grew apart which made me trapped in the party not able to finish a quest i had to delete my account and restart for keep going 
4,wow adhd helper for sure
4,at fırst it seems complicated but after some days you will find it handy and usefull it really organized my day if i could invite my friends via different social media it would be great in the mean time inviting them via email is the only choice
4,needs to push its updates more i didnt know there was an update
4,pretty buggy but good campion app for the desktop version
4,great app but has lots of bugs thats to be expected though for any app and they are doing good work
4,i like it but half the time when i press something nothing happens and it doesnt like it when ive pressed more than 3 things while the app has been open on my phone it will either freak out sending me somewhere i didnt ask for or it will close itself
4,really fun and keeps you working on day to day tasks
4,cool app would be better if it was as functional as the site re challenges
4,i do like the app its fun and has me coming back after i do something but i would like to get gems without purchasing a subscription im fine if its slow but i kinda wish there was a way
4,would be better if each habit had a separate reminder time
4,wish there were different skins for the app beyond fantasy eg scifi horror real life etc
4,please add archiving for stagnant dailies
4,maybe implement something that categorises and levels up specific areas such as creativity language programming diy home gardening hygiene fitness culinary skills etc everything seems to just bundle into general exp
4,cool but really confusing
4,i wish it was offline like people may not have an internet connection always and it will be a little annoying to see that you cant move forward without internet also i can find an option to repeat my to do list  like in google task you can set a time for it to remind you what to do and also you can make it repeat its sad that a app like this doesnt have such a basic thing
4,this is a great app i really enjoy using it there are a few minor bugs here and there but nothing serious that prevents functionality you can access guilds to chat with people about various topics and check off everything you need to do in a day with a little helpful motivation from party members definitely would recommend this app for those who are motivated for the next level up
4,great for getting organizated not sure how the social aspects of quests and guilds workplay into dayily actities
4,é um app bem legal para organizar tarefas simples do dia a dia ainda estou aprendendo a usar mas achei bem divertido
4,love it but would love it more if i could look into the future to see what i have scheduled easily
4,i enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life even if it was by a little bit the community is kind and friendly but i think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join i dont want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild
4,app is pretty good but everytime i add an item to my todo list or habits etc it goes back to the party tab so annoying to go back to tasks every time i add something
4,this app has actually really made a difference in my life i am so grateful but i feel it could be way better can you add in a timer for workouts and perhaps minigames the higher level your character the more powerful stuff like that  thank you devs
4,i really like the app but the downside is no offline mode this will be a better app if it had an offline mode
4,its a great app and its fun and intuitive to use but i do have one concern clear notifications button is not working as of the moment
4,cute app could do with a more usereasy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator
4,this is a fun way to build the keystone habit you need to make all your other daily habits click into place i think the mechanic of guilds is probably one of the most engaging things about it my critique is that in order to access the challenges available from the guilds youre in you have to get on your desktop this is super annoying because id rather only use the mobile app fix this and its an easy five stars
4,perfect app but you need to add night mode
4,great interface and concept what i appreciate most that other apps dont do is that they distinguish between habits dailies and to dos props also i love the guilds concept as well one suggestion is maybe have a clear visualization tool too see the progress made but i get it the point of this app is to level up your avatar overall good job 
4,love habit forming features wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists
4,need a combination for habits and dailies
4,turning your life into a rpg is a great way to stay motivated if they can provide something like a monthly habit tracker it would be great
4,this app has become my life i truly love it it helps me work towards my goals in a very funsupportive environment my down points would be mainly because of gems while the game is free there are certain things you can only get through buying gems which is understandable they need to be able to support themselvesthe game my problem is that while you can earn them for free its damn near impossible to compete with 200 people in one challenge and get rewarded
4,i have used habitica for a year now and i would suggest this app to anyone who wants to meet people with the same goal of building healthy habits i have met amazing people battled in hard quests which driven me to finish my dailies and joined a variety of challenges the app still has some glitches here and there but i mostly use the website
4,hi kindly show highest streak for a habbit which will act as high score to break the next time and we keep on improving our streaks sorry i took away a star
4,hey guys great game but im a mage and my mana keeps changing itll go to 300 and then ill level up and itll drop back down to 268 its been doing that for a few days please help us 
4,good but have more levels
4,it has very very few bugs in the mobile app but i love it
4,love it keeps me motivated but you should add something to share and make my friends join like an invite not the one you share your level up
4,great concept good community functions but some additional advicetutorial and examples for planning your day  tasks with this app would be great
4,this app is really cool and can help build many habits and keep track of to do lists however i would like options to customizer the avatar more like i accidentally added glasses and there isnt a option for none can you please add it
4,this app actually made me want to stick to my habits the moneyexp system is kind of broken and arbitrary fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it
4,i wish there was more interaction with party quests
4,great todo list app with addicting premise but cant remove glasses customization option once theyre on please change this i dont want my avatar to have glasses and cant remove them since the option doesnt appear to let me do so will change review to 5 stars once this is fixed
4,great app for those who need extra motivation this is just my idea but why dont add timed todo in image of monsters or something that will reduce the health of the protagonist or any negative effects if they did not finish it on time it may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate i think i got more ideas but will be too long to write here so anyway nice app cool app
4,it deserves more than 42 id rate it 45 for productivity
4,neat
4,good base needs greater rewards and harsher punishments include more visualaudio cues for success and failure take notes from other games that make a big show out to clicking a button which heightens the stimulation the player recieves
4,the app is what you make of it a big imagination will take you far i wish it had better mobile support though many functions require a computer and itd be nice to be able to preview all the cosmetic options that cost gems the cash currency without a preview its almost gambling especially with hairstyles
4,amazing app really motivating with an online support team but so long as its online only its hard to depend on it
4,i enjoy the app very much and its helping me kick some bad habits the only thing im not a big fan of is that it often times does not auto refresh after clicking an item or useing food other than that i like the app a lot
4,need to register before use
4,i love this app and all my friends use it and compete against each other this is a brilliant concept however the app seems a bit buggy i was in beta programme and then i was unable to send invites or buy certain items i thought its because of beta being unstable so i opted out of beta and reinstalled the app still didnt fix the issue im the party leader and the group isnset so that only i can start quests still anyone starts a quest without me knowing and i dont face this on browser
4,pretty good app however theres a point where im not making much progress unless i have gems i understand why the gems are there but as someone who isnt willing to spend money on an app it makes it a little boring overall great experience and helped with my habit building
4,getting my work done in a motivational way with friends in a group d
4,love the concept behind the app i feel silly but it still works i am able to complete most of my tasks my only suggestion would be please let the characters not be pixellated
4,i was introduced to this app by a friend and it definitely didnt disappoint the task manager is very fun to use and is extremely customizable and the events and group activities make it even more fun though the menu navigation could be improved as well as the rewards for doing tasks because i dont feel too motivated to do the tasks still
4,the auto populated list of dailies was neverending and repetitive who needs to floss 30 times a day i died because i didnt take the time to delete each one individually honestly when i scrolled down to try to find the end i couldnt find it and felt i was making no progress in deleting the duplicates
4,so far i like it however there are so many items on the lists when you first download it that it gave me anxiety you can only delete them 1 at a time and it wants confirmation before deleting each one if the developers see this i suggest only a few items on each list to give as an example instead of the 200 i found on my lists that all repeated although the check here for downloading the app gave a lot of xp
4,this is one of the best apps for self improvement available for gamers the idea the execution the design amazing my only gripe is that the error messages you get only sorta explain what went wrong and i have not successfully used the stat correction page once always error messages hopefully these bugs get worked out
4,its cute but the fact that i cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me i am going to stick to loop app
4,such a thoughtful selfhelp app life saving for adhd thank you for the wheelchair option in the icon the diversity was such a nice surprise i do wish there were different task layouts to choose from for the front page  im just easily confused i guess thank you staff
4,love this app and use it daily great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things  there are a couple of bugs though and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd the phone is the best place to keep a todo list as its always with you so i dont understand why the app isnt a priority im also missing an option to search or filter my inventory other than that i really like it
4,great app so far still not sure about how everyting worksplease can you create some warrior monk feature like shaolin rope ecc good job anyway
4,its a good app
4,it really is worth it to download this app thank you for designing this wonderful app thanks so much
4,awesome app love the prize feature i would give 5 stars if these two issues were solved 1 app does not notify me about dailies even though i set a reminder for 745am 2 one of my hobbies that can be checked as both positive and negative stays green forever after checking once does not refresh at night is that how its supposed to be
4,it was amazing i just didnt have the time to set it up all the way
4,habitica is the best productivity app ive used thus far it lasted me for months the quests are the most motivating feature and i was able to take down a couple bosses solo however motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive i had no chance of finding even one shard unless youre comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible
4,сам сервис очень крутой но пожалуйста сделайте более понятный интерфейс для habits пусть они они становятся серыми или изчезают когда человек отметил свой прогресс за день я банально не помню отмечала я свой прогресс сегодня или ещё нет а показатель в виде цифры или зелёногорыжего цвета мне ни о чем не говорит
4,great concept has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so i dont loose life and earn exp just one thing i cant do quests i got the dust bunnies quest but i have no clue what to do with it help
4,this app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af
4,great app i would like more progression content resetting levels is easy implementation but gets stale quickly mages do too much damage but this app had been transformative and amazing i will consider contributing to development
4,this is wonderful but i really need to be able to use it offline as well
4,i couldnt change the language of this software i tried it again and again but the language didnt change
4,i love this game it has helped me do much its a bit of a learning curve it would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds and i would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked because the colors dont always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing otherwise this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way i can afford
4,lol i went to settings change character value and got myself 9m coins uwu btw is that cheating i mean well its right there
4,it worked fine for a while but now every time i click on a taskhabitgoal to edit the app crashes i can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine but i cant edit anything now please look into fixing it soon edit thank you the latest update fixed it all
4,great for adhd
4,ive tried quite a few rpglike todo list apps and i must say this one is the only one that i find genuinely enjoyable and actually kinda feels like a game you can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye although i think there should be a way to uncheck todos i keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying
4,could be better if it was completely free
4,so far so good you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out its a rpg game based off of truth the app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order
4,i like this app and its really helped but now i cant open it anymore it crashes while loading every time ive tried troubleshooting restarting deleting the cache but nothing seems to work
4,thank you i love the app and its helping me immensely already the only suggestion i can think of is i wish there was a way of keeping track of my previously completed tasks so i could look back on the progress ive made it would feel much more meaningful that way and serve as additional motivation
4,there are some things i feel need to be ironed out eg i found feeding the petsmounts a bit buggy but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them
4,it has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals but there seems to be a bug  i cant seem to receive a friends party invite though i am able to create my own party and invite friends to it its a one way street in my app joining guilds and the selfcare selfsabotage info have been most educational and helpful
4,the ios app is lot better than this please improve it as soon as possible
4,best app for daily routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings you should improve that because some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level
4,i like the app a lot but some features are a little annoying i have a few suggestions  more ways to tweak what the widgets look like currently they take up a lot of space  it would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing  task subcategories please   biggest gripe because of the way the entire list item is like a button i keep accidentally checking tasks that werent actually done bugged unchecking pls fix thanks
4,i just want to say that the tutorial was too much info things like this should be explained in a short and concise way at a good pace it was just too long and too much to take in i didnt even try the app though i cant say what rating it deserves i am unnistalling but i may come back to it in the future its not you its me also you cant delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop i suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features
4,its been a good way to get things done and the concept of an rpg is very well executed the reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface my wife uses it on ios and it is lightyears beyond what we have on android much cleaner more useful information and less clunkiness
4,this app is an awesome and fun todo list i like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day however the app crashes whenever i try to sort todos by scheduled and its getting a bit frustrating
4,pretty good app that helps me stay organized could use a few improvements but overall i enjoy it
4,habitica is awesome only thing that its hard to feed your pets with the app
4,couldnt create my avatar at first but after that it worked fine
4,great idea and im enjoying it so far chores and errands are much more fun my one gripe so far is that it seems like most itemsquests cost gems which are pay to play im afraid ill pretty quickly run out of free itemsquests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness itd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them like reaching extra high levels of productivityhabit building etc
4,so far its pretty good ive been using it about a week sometimes it doesnt refresh but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly there is a lot that i am learning through users that isnt actually explained in the app like if you dont do all your daily tasks the whole party takes damage so yeah no pressure it would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed inappfisttime traininglearning session every first should option for more info
4,really nice app that is easy to use would be cool to see a feature where you can build things like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing taskshabits
4,the apps a bit glitchy not gonna lie but it helps tremendously in my daytoday life the community aspect of it is amazing i actually feel motivated by all the kind words good job developers my lifes a bit less bleak now c
4,its pretty good so far my dailies just seem to never reset though i got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward
4,this app is good and its useful yes its true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and i like it i wish it had an offline mode because i cant stay on all the time but i can see why we need to be online at all times
4,this app has really helped me get my stuff in order it also has an active community and good challenges it is a bit glitchy at times things dont refresh etc but overall its great edit lol the report a bug is glitched on my phone p i had to manually send my info over in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day wont reset  been broken for a week
4,not very expressive frame for activity descriptions must be in the first stages of development guilds look incredible diverse very surprising it is a social app seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded hope open sourcing it make it better fit passing habits to todo would be desirable
4,im easily motivated by things like points and streaks so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety i use rewards for breaks and find that i get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often because i can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with i also get my long complicated multipart projects done early i gave it four stars because there are a couple of features id like to see but it works great as is
4,im surprised this app actually works for me it helped me procrastinate less but i also realised it works only if i remind myself to check the app a lot i recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself even if the game style of this app isnt your thing its a great todolist app for habits daily reminders and general todo items only complaint is its glitchy for me when i want to customise my avatar
4,ive been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is there are a few loading issues every so often if those bugs werent there id give 5 stars all around though enjoyable easy to use and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits
4,i really like the concept of this app the style the features and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life however the app needs some serious redesigning the layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless the way challenges are organized could also use improvement all in all i like using it make an account a month ago but the functionality needs to be improved
4,would love love love an offline mode as i dont have internet access at all time but adore this app to keep me on top of my life and mental and physical health
4,can this please get a feature where i can add tasks when offline and it uploads to the server whenever i connect to the internet at the moment it simply deletes everything
4,i love this format only thing that would make it better is some form of active side scrolling gameplay element build your character throughout the week and then try to beat a level sort of thing
4,this is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things the daily tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app youve got the ability to create todo lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed on top of all this seeing your character earn experience new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly awesome rpg
4,a great idea and the app itself has been improved a fair bit but still a little bit too slow to respond to give five stars seems a bit like server congestion maybe
4,very cool app
4,ive been using this app for about a year now i think i love keeping myself accountable and tracking what im doing and what im not each day lately ive been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat none of which mention me ive switched off push notifications completely but theyre still coming through all the time this is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars
4,the app is good and all the only problem is that the reminder does not work
4,fun for university students the only problem is they dont order the tasks by date do you have to be careful not to miss homework now that i think about it its actually a big problem for students using the app it is fun overall and i do homework to keep my avatars alive think tamagotchi
4,so far i love it
4,amazing app some glitchy moments but overall nothing too annoying this app is so cool that im ok with some glitches because in a very short time its already brought so much value to my life brilliant idea to get you into good habits and out of bad ones in my experience it actually works
4,fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged for five stars it would need to include a calendar function
4,have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress in real life even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic really like it and it has made a big difference the only reason i took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if i am in the app for very long such as when i am shopping or browsing challenges so i do these things mostly on my pc overall great job would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world
4,i wish i could control the reminders for my tasks more like the volume or what noise it makes other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done
4,every other month i think ill do better i try again i download this app everything gets back in order so i uninstall it to free up space in my storage then i relapse i download the app again this is a never ending cycle of desperation loss and hope i will always download this app i will always uninstall it 910 would recommend
4,разработчик исправил ошибку которая не давала начать и оказалось что приложение довольно хорошее норежим испытания  бред ктото его использует по фану и исход решает рандом ктото пиарит свой ютуб каналтак же нет приоритизации сложности целейте кто то поставит сложной целью написать диплом а кто то сходить в магазиндорогов игровой валюте стоят квесты за неделю так и не получил хотя целей было много удалил его так как мне не подходит дизайн для офиса но это уже особенность
4,i have been using habitica for quite some time now and i must say it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day however the todos are very limited in its functions its hard to implement a full task management such as gtd methodology it pretty much only supports next action steps not any layers such as projects or waiting for also syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic i hope they will improve the todos and make syncing smoother
4,such a cool app im in love with it sad that it doesnt work properly offline though  also has bugs
4,its a great start to improving your life but its more or less just a planner app
4,amazing app but the extremely buggy ui have made the app irritating to use and sometime unusable without a restart
4,i like it a lot but it doesnt have as much of the game aspect to it i wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned you could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories without it it doesnt really incentivize much
4,its amazing i just wish there was goals and categories for tasks
4,a great app for tracking goals and habits it is also the most fun since you achieve virtual goals xp and gold to level up your character will give 55 if it had a dark theme
4,quite confusing
4,nice but why does it need data tho
4,its ok little confusing at first i think some more of the features that are in the add a blah should be a bit more clear also a report a bug option would be nice my entire phone is on silent cause im at work app still makes sounds
4,this app can save your life love how you can pin widgets to your home screen on android phones only suggestion is to add a calendar
4,great way to manage your tasks only downside is you set the deadlines and can knowingly chance them at any time
4,incredible for keeping motivation up but the mobile app is intermittently buggy in odd ways definitely still highly recommend it though
4,the concept is absolutely amaizing but the procedures are very complex can you plaese make another app with same concept and with simple procedures in simple words please make a simple app which has concept of gaming type rewards on completing important tasks
4,perfect app but its missing an important tab its already got habits dailies and todos but it doesnt have a bucket listlife goals tab for me it doesnt feel right to put learn a new recipe in the todo tab i also want to put in my goals like focus on getting high grades or get a girlfriend i cant put these in other tabs
4,buggy but awesome
4,would be perfect if i could organize the todos by date theyre random right now
4,very nwice hi how can i sort my todos according to due date is there any way i can team up with local players also is any offline version coming up just to check off tasks thanks
4,i used this all the time before and it was fun in the beginning but got really tired of the low res graphics if they were a bit more high def it would be amazing we could finally see the equipment customization better  more motivating to continue using and complete tasks
4,ill give it a 55 once yall make it functional offline  like maybe allow us to editcross off tasks offline and let it automatically sync once connected to the internet
4,good app with good widgets one star deducted as i cant work out how to view completed tasks dailies and habits
4,i guess i love it as it kind of works i mean this is as good as an app can get for its purpose it has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable the biggest problem i have is at the beginning its very challenging to keep alive as you have no partyarmour yet and also as far as im aware i could only edit the order of the dailies i wish they can be done to other sectors too
4,great app i just wish there was a way to keep track of time on a taskhabbit builtin timer instead of having to open an external timer
4,this app has been so helpful for me to be more productive as i didnt take care kf myself before i cant complain about anything except sometimes when i first log in for the day my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today i would love to see why soandso points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies like clean medium 6 health or something like that i dont think ill ever delete this app and i look forward to any updates
4,it is fun every time i get an eggfoodpotion though i have to drag down the spinning wheel to let it reload 
4,the app version has so much more to improve aside from being buggy a lot of features are still missing compared tovthe web version four stars because it helps me nonetheless i wish the team best of luck and thank you for habitica 
4,just started using and seems interesting hope itll help me to improve my life one issue i have is that it does not give an option to sort todo task by deadlines which is better to see which tasks are urgent and not overlooked hope theres an update to add this function
4,rlly goodjust 4 for bugs but its really good
4,i cannot pinunpin rewards after ui updated plz fix it i love this game
4,with the new update when you tap tasks or the eggs and hatching potions you have to close and reopen the app in order to get it to load but otherwise the update is really cool
4,app doesnt work without internet connection everything else is great
4,excellent app great habit tracker ive found in this app an exciting way to be productive there are some bugs and functionalities that need to be fixed however its worth using it i really recommend it
4,to do list and reward system works for me when regular lists dont cut it chat in the app has a bug that keeps you from seeing what you are typing
4,easiest way for me to use habitica simple but motivating im not sure if moving the plus button to the center was a good idea it covers more of the text of the tasks there though it is a easy to forget that you need to pull down on the tasks section to see any changes in inventorytables
4,very help
4,oh my goodness im so sorry if i pressured you guys i actually just listened to thomas franks podcast with you guys from a few years ago and learned more about habitrpgs history and its developers i love how responsive you guys are unlike some other app developers they didnt send me any feedback on an issue neither did they try resolve it anyways ill just leave a 4star so that you guys could be motivated to get a 5star love your work shout out from the ph
4,make it easier to understand when youre activating quests i didnt have anyone in my party by i was still somehow doing it and finished it by myself without realizing it make a design changerenaming so that theres something labeled start quest still a fun and useful app growth is neverending
4,i am a big gamer and always found my self more motivated by games thank you for making my life action list more fun and rewarding
4,just downloaded the apploving the idea of adding my own habits  to do stuff which i used to tick off daily on notepaduff now i am glad its automated with rewards tooyayhave a suggestion to make all sections of list tabs movable updown like the rewards section to organise as per customisable preference
4,love the idea but the execution is kind of clumsy theres little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work and the rewards seem to be random at best the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options ie mounts food eggs etc that seem mostly arbitrary
4,wonderful app
4,the app is great but is it possible to see the tasks from your group
4,how can i set it so that a task would show the remaining days until its due like on the pc rather than showing the date its due i find the countdown of remaining days to be more useful than the date
4,really enjoy the app probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with also please set up a system of weekly tasks currently you can only set a daily that you complete once a week but it would be nice to have the flexibility of doing a task any day that week without being penalised
4,great app still getting in to and it looks like there is some content that is only accessible by paying real money but i really love the old school art style
4,i would have reported this as a bug within the app but i found another bug when trying to do that first one when submitting a bug or feedback it does not pass through the to address into the email so im not sure where to send it to second one when editing a habit daily or todo text field the keyboard pops up and disappears a workaround on this for my device is to rotate the phone landscape using pixel 3 otherwise a very good app
4,it really helps
4,widgets have disappeared
4,guys  i really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars everything is there and i can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much but on android the habits screen is quite buggy and wont let me adjust the streaks the keyboard comes up but closes immediately so i cant do anything the dailies work fine i look forward to any updates youre planning but considering this is free i think what youve achieved is great
4,we are using this as a group in my family and it honestly is helping us a lot with staying motivated i have a difficult time with my anxiety and depression but this app has helped me to feel a sense of accomplishment i am experiencing inspiration a little more often and i have been struggling for years with this there are some aspects im not entirely fond of that i hope will continue to be updated however im grateful to the developers for making and keeping up with this
4,great motivator especially with the whole online and boss battle aspect far too pay to play however
4,i never enjoyed doing my todo list as much as this before there are some bugs though
4,amazing app but still you guys need make a lot of changes in ui for eg i am unable to decide how much coins should i get with one positive and all task should reset at a specified time by user
5,fantastic habit forming app the staff is so kind and helpful my reading skill and general cleanliness are castle improved i love forming a party with friends and doing all the little quests together
5,great experience this app has made me more productive and engaged love it
5,i find it so hard fitting things inremembering to do things but this app makes it a breeze grateful to have it 
5,made productivity really fun
5,best gamification app
5,makes daily chores feel like a game habitica has this thing where you collect an extensive list of gears and animal companion when you complete tasks i love collecting items so choosing the rogue class out of the other 3 is probably the best choice for me theres so much more to it too 
5,i really love this app really multifunction and really good
5,nice app tp start a new habit
5,great idea great app
5,worked extremely well for me with getting organized and gamifying everyday tasks has a really helpful community
5,previous issue was fixed by developers thanks for getting back in a timely manner great application and is a fun way to keep yourself motivated being a gamer myself it is a nice change of pace to your traditional tracking app
5,great app help helps me get stuff done compared to other socalled adult  serious not childish app
5,new ui design is amazing only one mistake when i edit a task the save button is not showing but i can click thatlook into it edit its fixed now already thank you 
5,i love it d i met great and fun people and this is the only todo apps that really makes me do it or else ill die oof i love the concept and all but i kinda wish that therell be more default costumes like the hair that is free or some that can be bought by coins if possible and maybe the background too anyways overall i love it it was really effective for me keep up the good work ill look forward on it
5,what would i do without this seriously i dont know this has honestly helped me work out and floss how dumb is that i dont want to disappoint my party so i have a certain amount of reps and chores to take care of every day and darn it i do them i have 100 seen improvement in my musclemass it seems so weird but this gamewhatever you want to call it has started to make me buffer and i love it
5,best app ive used to help me stick with habits they change colors ranging from deep red to light blue to show the how well you are doing with the habit the support features and articles help you customize the app in many ways to fit your needs
5,this app is amazing its exactly what i need to keep track of my goals cleaning tasks and todos the widgets were a game changer and allowed me to basically create my perfect bullet journal spread on my phone and they already gameified it for me so i dont have to truly a blessing of an app
5,habitica has been a massive positive push in my life i dont make alot of game reviews but i kinda felt like i had to for this one i have adhd and it mainly affects my executive function which gives me alot of issues with procrastinating and putting things off and letting things like my personal hygiene and im ashamed to admit this but the care for my animals go having a place to manage all that with an immediate repercussion even if digital has been a wonderful motivator
5,this app has helped my family and i maintain a daily routine despite the emotional rollercoaster that has been 2020 updates sometimes cause bugs but theyre rather charming  are quickly corrected whether youre using this solo with irl friends or ones you make through the app habitica will help
5,i wish it will be widget in next update please
5,used to love this app but recently its become very buggy i can no longer use the check boxes for dailies or todos please fix this app update appears that whatever bug occurred has been fixed
5,i love this app the new dark mode is great you guys fix any problems really fast and listen to the people who use habitica which i appreciate cheers
5,one of the most flexible productivity apps i have used works as a habit tracker daily reminder list and a todo list which is great if you want to have an overview of all these things inside a single app makes your tasks feel less overwhelming by keeping the theme light and fun the devs add new content to it constantly and the community is able to create guilds and challenges offering a more social experience than most other productivity apps
5,its a nice to do list app for me separating things into habits dailies and to dos isnt something i really thought about so its helped me plan what i want a bit better i just wish there was a late night mode where it acts as if its yesterday so you can accurately reminesce about what you did that day i usually plan things out at night also turning a to do into a nice grocery list would be nice too trying to put it in the notes of a to do doesnt really work since you cant check
5,useful needs a good internet connection i can do banking and then find that my connection is not good enough for habitica i have used this for well over two years and even at work its a nice boost to my feeling of accomplishment when i get things done great coop with family too very responsive devs
5,the best habit and to do list tracking app
5,increible la mejor app para organizar tu vida
5,this app saved my life
5,this makes me so much more productive
5,this app changed my life
5,i noticed how obsessive i was about getting an achievement in some video gamelike a new gun module etc i would grind for ages i thought what if i did this kind of work in real life i would be so far ahead so i thought to look for a gamification app habiticia fit perfectly im using the same obsessed attitude and all my thousands of hours of childhood training i have to achieve in video games games for achieving my daily habits thank you you saved me instant 1 year sub
5,this is one of the best to do lists that i have used  even googles to do lists pales on comparisoni was surprised to find no constant ads or a pro mode which these things usually have the widgets are almost perfect except for the hobbies make that 1x1 but its a really good experience overall  i recommend using it  it helps a lot gamifying ur to do list makes you more eager to do them  thank you for a to do list that is totally free  i definitely recommend this
5,quite fun actually started keeping up with good habits already just to hatch some pets
5,idk why i still stop doing my habits
5,phenomenal productivity application
5,one of the few apps i can truly say that is life changing
5,this app is amazing truly sure there are still minor bugs that existed from years ago when i started my first account but the amount of progress it went through during that time period just shows how much the developers care and how much effort theyve put even just from the display in towards realizing this wonderful app for all of us who are looking to better our lives thank you so much
5,i absolutely love this app it has helped me a lot organizing my time and creating positive habits
5,edit the app gets better with every update and i hadnt had any bugs for a while now i absolutely love how it looks after the latest update  super clean and fresh 5 stars and many thanks to the hardworking devs love habitica i find the app often has one bug or another from update to update so cant really give 5 stars but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me
5,awesome stuff i just wonder if its possible to have a choice for dates to be sorted from daymonthyear since thats what im used to other than that great job
5,thank you for the wonderful update been using the app for years because of the great update i bought gems as gratitude to the developers thanks
5,wow new app ui is looking great
5,thank you for the update i have been waiting for dark mode since months best app ever
5,this app is really amazing there are different categories to sort your tasks into to suit your particular needs the rpg aspect is really well done your productivity reflects on your avatar in a surprisingly immersive way its rich with a variety of items equipment and cosmetic customisations for your avatar the quest feature is a great way for people to socialise productively and hold each other accountable in a fun and creative way ive never loved getting things done more
5,love the new ui before you cant look at tasks when offline its fixed now you can also filter the tags
5,really helped with motivation
5,this app has been a game changer for productivity in my life there is soooo much to do and explore
5,amazing app love it
5,i like this app but currently theres a glitch which isnt letting me delete dailies and habits left over from older challenges which have been closed now please look into this i tried re  installing and using the website version but nothing worked
5,cant recommend it enough get a party and youll make friends super fast and get loooooads of motivation no ads no annoying popups only teamwork motivation and rpg magic perfect app cant thank it enough
5,this app helped me so much with acquiring and maintaining good habits its amazing i adore it deeply and will continue to support it  ive bought a yearly subscription  totally worth it this app is lovely and developers deserve all of the praise they can get  love you guys keep up an outstanding work
5,the best way to help a nerd getting hs tasks done i use it everyday
5,habitica isnt just helping me stay productive and organized its also really fun to use and makes me want to do stuff id otherwise try to avoid i love everything about the app especially the social features like guilds and partys which make the whole experience even better
5,like it it has items and you become a character that takes dmg and lvl up even got a pet love it
5,im only a few days in but i gotta say this feels like virtual adderall im excited to get things done now my todo list doesnt scare me anymore and i no longer deal with crippling anxiety about all the stuff i didnt do every night when i try to sleep definitely feels like ive hacked my reward system fingers crossed this isnt just a honeymoon period because for the first time in ages im enjoying getting things done no more stress  just dopamine
5,nice app finally some good frikin friends
5,excelente para organização pessoal e ainda se diverte com o jogo
5,this app has already helped me so much and i got it a week ago
5,great app that helps me keep organized and motivated fun spin on a todo list
5,simplify your life with the leveling up system and  categorizing  organizations
5,this is a very unique and interesting game and its really been helping me keep schedule during quarantine which is amazing and really makes me happy but it only gets four stars because sometimes it doesnt keep content i used a royal purple hatching potion on one of my tiger eggs i had two and both items disappeared from my inventory but i didnt get my tiger which is really disheartening very willing to fix this review if it suddenly shows up but i dont think it will editfixed
5,great app has kept me on track with my goals
5,the grindy gamer in me refuses to not be rich in coins buy in order to get coins i need to finish tasks i dont even feel like studying is studying anymore studying has become grinding for a game making me want to do it more
5,awesome the last time i used this app was about 3 years ago now i use it again and found the updates are amazing
5,the best habit forming tool ever whether you pay any attention to the game aspect or not
5,this app is great ive only had it for a few days and im addicted its so fun and helps to get rid of habits and create new ones it helps me get things done its so cool i love the fact that if you want something youve got to earn it and it makes you feel good about completing tasks it doesnt always tell you to rate the app andor share it which is another plus 1110 i do recommend
5,i love this app it only app that keeps my interested i love the to do list habits and daily  then if you want you have a change to challenge yourself i wish they had a search bar to search up challenge maybe a group and create group button and way to invite friends and become friends with your real friends so you can do challenges together but i would totally reccomend this app download it now you will not regret it 
5,best habit tracker app ever
5,this app changed my life im more willing to do the hard parts of my day because i dont want to take more damage seriously this app is a god send and i even subscribed
5,i love this app very much when the quarantine started i gained a few kilos didnt exercise enough and would sit on my phone all day when i found this app i started to do things  even making habits that i want to have also this app is also a semirpg game so its a really big plus 5 stars guaranteed
5,this app combines all the features ive been looking for into one simple interface
5,i love this app as it actually help me to change habits
5,dame great app
5,i am completely in love with this app this app has changed my life completely which is why i want it to get even better here is a small recommendation make a 4 week calender system abcd week so that if you want to make a schedule where you take 1 day off after 3 days of work it is completely possible to make a routine that will keep repeating itself 4dayx74x7day by simple math once you get to 5th week you are back to the same pattern as that of 1st week and so the cycle goes on
5,best productivity app ever
5,this is a really fun and awesome why to help you sort your life with the bonus of dopmine fun things
5,so far this seems super cool im excited to try it more and leave a more informed review
5,trying to be productive
5,just love this appits really awesome for managing your dailies and todosfor anyone who loves gamified version of work to be done this app is all yours 
5,update made it working again hats off to the hard working devs eager to try it
5,i love this so much
5,love it such a brilliant idea and really well executed one of the best apps ive ever used
5,one of the best apps that ive used so far im a procrastinator due to which my grades had suffered a lot i came across this app on a site and decided to give it a try one of my best decisions
5,i really really love this app the gamifying is really good and i especially love the guilds with various creative monthly challenges another pro is that most people dont spend too much time chatting the chatting is limited to a healthy amount cuz ppl r busy with tasks and it is still social enough to provide enough encouragement sharing of thoughts and pointless banter to take ur mind off stressful stuff 
5,this app has helped me in doing my tasks on time it helps me to be more accountable and be more responsible enough the gamified style kept me going as i see how much my character levels up
5,just like solo leveling
5,best productivity app ive used
5,excellent app i would rate it 65 if calendar option somehow exist imagine you do have birdseye view in days weeks or even years may not be a ratingreview more kinda suggestions hehe admins and developers great job salute to them for making this app awesome 
5,great tool to develop new habits i owe habitica a lot
5,by far the coolest darn app i have ever played in my life i love the whole concept of what is trying to be portrayed here i doubt id actually be good at it because i kind of procrastinate on things a lotbut it sure is fun already so maybe ive got a chance but thank you developers for creating this this can really help people towards their futurein the most bizarre but absolutely amazing and fun way
5,keeps me focused
5,love it pretty simple and it helps me get things done and even helped to break bad habits like sleeping wayyy too late and waking up at like 12pm i havent talked to other users all that much but from reading tavern messages the community seems very helpful and supportive ive been using habitica for about a year now and i plan to continue using it until i can finally get things done without having to be threatened by a party quest boss lol 1110
5,very nice productivity rpg game
5,this is the best this inspired me to complete my tasks that i always seem to forget in doing i also had fun at the same time i really love the rpgstyle theme while using this i realized almost all rpg mechanism are in this but trading so i hope you guys put a trading system or item gifting or whatsoever in the next updates also i wanna try becoming a subscriber for free so hope you guys give me atleast a 1 mo trial hehe
5,i love this app it helps me so much when i want to get something done and when i need to do something daily like take my vitamins or wash the dishes there are also so much nice people when you join guilds 1010 would recommend to a friend note this app is way more helpful if youre into games points and competitiveness im very competitive  but its still super helpful even if youre not that interested in that stuff again 1010 would definitely recommend
5,actually for once in my life am getting stuff done lol
5,awesome ive become way more organized after starting to use this app absolutely loved it keep up the hard work dev
5,it just works
5,helped me get in control of my habits helps me keep accountable the setup allows me to select how difficult any task is and scales to it very helpful
5,ive only just started up but this app has progressed so much since i last saw it ui is really tidy and easy to use it doesnt feel like everything is locked behind a paywall though i plan to support tasksrewardsetc are easy to customize so the game can be tailored to exactly what you need i have adhd so an app that makes every task a funnovel experience is fantastic im hoping this becomes a well worn tool in my belt thanks to the devs for creating such a useful resource 
5,even without an rpg element this app is robust enough to suit any of your habit tracking needs its ridiculous how much better this app is compared to other regular paid or unpaid habit trackers
5,really love this i enjoy the complexity and the fact that you can buy rewards for keeping up with stuff and that there and consequences for not doing your dailies
5,this app really changed my life i was able to make my life work with this ive been trying to get my life on track and out of depression and this app showed me how now i am keeping my house clean keeping up with my social life doing homeschool with my kids and keeping up with then  i didnt think that was possible last year
5,helps me so much like seriously commit to this get into a party kind of an online group for this rpg and it may help you like its helped me i am really lazy so the progress im making is miraculous it really kind of forces you to do what you need to do and its my favorite mobile game there is hats off to the developers and anyone else involved
5,amazing creative and motivating kudos designers love the gameboy pixellated feel really made me nostalgic amazing app
5,this app is very nice it did help me
5,took me awhile to figure it out the mechanics are interesting the design is fun it helps me build and quit some habits that i have been trying to
5,fun
5,ive been using this as a motivation and selfrewarding todo list it works and there a lot of communities of people here ranging from lgbt to mental illness its great
5,it just might be one of the best apps ever made it has helped so much with my productivity and has such wonderful features i love it
5,i will reinstall this app
5,the app is really smart
5,helps me turn my crippling depression into regular depression
5,thanks for free widget
5,im thoroughly enjoying this app so far ive been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies the game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing selfmade goals and gaining experience and items
5,super fun way to keep up with tasks
5,it was amazing
5,great i would recommend the following features  skills when you work on a task you could select which skills you will be working on  a timer keep track of how long you spent working on a task and consequently on the skills this would allow a summary of how long the player spent on each skill  maybe skill trees being able to create publix skill trees for a projecthobbyetc would be a very nice feature too
5,very good app to help keep and develope new habits best gamification of tasks habits and to do lists
5,its hard to not get bored when i being serious on something so i always think that life is a game and this is a great app that can help me to get rid from my boredom when i build my good habits thank you very much for the developer 5 stars from me 
5,love the app so far great for motivation but nonpunishing cute graphics and lots of stuff to explore splitting up tasks by prioritytype is awesome it really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting gaming or seeing your progress add up one note is that sometimes lists of tasks disappearshow tasks already completed closing and reopening fixes it but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed
5,best productivity app
5,the game aspect is fun and can provide a little added motivation but beyond that its one of the best free todo apps ive found the organization is easy and the breakdown of habits daily or other schedule tasks on repeat and a one time todo list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more professional if you like the gameify idea this app is great if you want a solid free task manager ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well
5,very creative and a good idea too
5,very usefull and fun

5,loving the app so far and has helped me stay on track with some chores and my v small complaint is that the date is expressed wrong for 90 of the world as mmddyy wish i could change to ddmmyy any way to change that setting on the horizon
5,the best app for motivation and tracking even putting the game aspect aside i have never seen a more userfriendly app for habittask tracking i love how there are different categories for habits tasks and daily todos its customizable getting coins is motivation ive recommended it to everyone only thing i wish it had a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits for instance most health lost due to blank etc
5,its been a week since i started using this and i so already love this thanks
5,habitica is a lot of fun to use it helps me more to be productive by applying rpg concept into my everyday tasks the quests and collectibles are also fun to do  it is so rewarding
5,habitica had helped me a lot in my efforts to improve my life ive been using habitica for 2 years now and it really provide me with the motivation  support needed for me to achieve my objectives
5,this is an awesome app idea for really anyone to use just a great app
5,awesome app helps me keep track of my daily tasks and routine i like the fun reward and punishment system in the form of an rpg game keep up the good work
5,great way to keep track of things to do on the computer and phone
5,i didnt think this would work but it really does help to build habits the interface is pretty simple and easy to understand the complexity grows over time id really like a way to share todos with a group reward those for taking the initiative to take some of the teams shared tasks
5,super great
5,i seriously like it
5,thank you this made a difference
5,one of the best habit organisation apps and it gamifies on top the only feature that i would really need is managing dailies in groups like meals in groupetc
5,what an adorable and inspirational app i have actually done things i was considering putting off because i didnt want to lose too much life and thus important items i really needlike ive even gotten my partner to download it it also doesnt penalize you too harshly for falling off the wagon so to speak and not using it for some time as in days to years its the perfect combination of motivational and understanding which is the perfect recipe for success at least for myself 
5,really helps me to keep things organized and is a great way to keep myself on track
5,its great but i need to make a habit to use the app
5,just love it
5,does what it says but unable to rearrange the tasks to my liking via the app have to use the browser to do that
5,excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones
5,life changing app if you have any affinity to video games and want to better your life youre in the right place this app saved me
5,excellent app they greatly improved the quality since last time i used it im a user of the web page for 5 year now and the app was a little outdated but know it is very complete and useful thank you
5,it sounds crazy but this app has basically changed my life im more productive every day as this game motivates me to get my life together i like how i can give myself credit even for the little things the house chores no one will pay you to do or thank you for but that still need to be done it can also be very social if you want it to be
5,amazing app one request from the developers this app is turning humans into better humans so the rouge class should be renamed to the ninja or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing itthis pure psychology and this is how low of attraction works never talk or think of things which you dont want in life you yourself would not want anyone to be rouge so please give rouge some positive polish if you can only a humble suggestion
5,i have used this tool continuously since 2015 and its a fun way to get yourself to do tasks that otherwise you might not be motivated to do ive been a subscriber for almost two years i would highly recommend habitica whether you prefer to do it all on your own quest with others take up challenges or just keep track of your flossing theres a lot to out and ive never gotten bored in almost five years
5,awesome it really helps me to level up my life
5,changed my life the group feature when you have a family is a must have seeing our avatars morph and change while we level up our life priceless this app is worth it its one of the best decisions ive made for me and my children theyre excited to do chores and i no longer procrastinate i just cant recommend this app enough
5,a good app love the concept helped me
5,this is the first time i found an app which can read my mind this app really knows the scientific importance of reward i really advice anyone to install this app and give it a try especially if you are a student
5,it is awesome super helped me but i have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them
5,ive never enjoyed accountability before this our whole family partied up and is having a blast playing to do chores wonderful concept
5,im really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow downside is the glasses and headband cant come off the avatar so my character is stuck with them for awhile
5,super helpful for habits and breaking bad ones
5,what an absolute boon my boyfriend has adhd and a love for video gamesthis app helps him remember and complete tasks much more easily than unengaging notesapp checklists it really does wonders for motivation habitica is helping me survive grad school and manage the mental load of day to day activities im really excited for the new groups feature to be rolled out as well thank you so much habitica
5,loving the app so far just a minor note i cant seem to unequip my avatars glasses or headband
5,this is great after having played it for three days i was begging my mom for chores to do
5,getting into it following the mechanics and i feel motivated to do ans comolete stuff to earn exp i havent used it much but im satisfied already one small thing i cant choose to wear no glasses and i believe this is an unintentional error
5,10 out 10 recommend for anyone who wants to stay organized and goal oriented without knowing youre doing it this app is for beginners looking for a concept to start planing or motivating  go getters who want a fun and resourceful way to sort your goals and stay motivated
5,i love habitica ive used it for several years both the browser version and the app i love how simple it is and i love the social aspect ive been able to make friends and find support through guilds and my party really pushes each other to be our best and continually improve this app has helped me focus on self care and get better grades in school im building healthy habits and having fun with the creative quests and interactions habitica is amazing
5,has really helped me get more done and stay on task
5,the best out there
5,i love habitica it works to make the things i have to do at least somewhat rewarding and i can set fun goals for boring tasks
5,great app i dont even play video games but i love the set up of this application the split into habits dailies and tasks is perfect the streaks and rewards are motivational i like the capability to set reminders and being able to have a task list widget on my home page i tried a couple other to do apps and none have kept me consistent besides this one
5,great no errors found super useful fun good design and small i guess super recommended
5,with your friends you can play this game you progress by completing tasks you set for yourself often i see t the app and think well 10 pushups isnt that hard might as well do it without the app i wouldnt have thought that set small tangible goals it motivates me to do the things i want to do but cant get in the habit of doing
5,fantastic app i have tried many other productivity app and used to find it difficult to follow them every day after i switched to this app it became all fun and i am getting motivated to complete the tasks as i earn rewards suggestion to developer i use browser version more than mobile app please add reminder feature to browser version as well also please add auto date parser while adding the task it will save a lot of time in entering the task you ca take reference from ticktick app
5,i love the interface the overall concept and easiness of interface rewarding and fun to use has helped me alot with my life goals
5,the only app that really helped getting through my really busy schedule
5,helpful and fun
5,love this app if you need help sticking to a schedule meeting goals or want to better your life in any way this app is for you guilds and challenges promote productivity separate categories for habits positivenegative daily tasks and todos keep the app structured wish there were more items and rpg aspects after reaching a certain level though
5,i love this app it keeps me on track and i have fun while doing it whatever aspect of you daily life you want to improve you can set tasks and goals to help you achieve it 
5,really helped me stay on top of online classes this year
5,i love this app its helped me so much theres only a few things that bother me about it like how you cant change the order of dailies but besides that its fantastic
5,the best app for people with or without adhd
5,this app is fantastic it helps to organize tasks and bring new positive habits into your life and does it in a gamified entertaining way you should at least try it out
5,thank you
5,very nice app lets you make reminders and actually feel rewarded once you do it
5,the app has improved over the time ive been using it there are a few things that would be useful to have for example the ability to search for challenges like in the website on another point this app has really helped me improve in different areas of my life
5,love love love the idea behind this
5,the best app to become a better person and acheive your daily goals developing great habits the whole community is cheerful and i may thank you for taking the time to develope such great considerate features for free youve really helped us all 
5,please keep tinkering and improving thank you for this app
5,i love this app its amazing and has made me a bit more productive with the few days ive had it i just wish there was some sort of game that comes with it i know it isnt the point of the app but i feel like if some sort of game was added there would be more incentive to do all your tasks i know its probably just me who has this issue but a game really would add a lot to the app even a tiny one
5,app keeps crashing when launching couldnt even get past the title screen edit after signing into the website version tried to install the app again and apparently it worked
5,why why my habit streaks keep disappearing every single day  edit thank you developers i didnt notice that option i love this app
5,so far the best productivity app with this being productive is fun
5,i soooo love this app i am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive you wouldnt want your avatar to die so youll do your tasks
5,this app has helped me make my days more productive and i like the way its put together two suggestions for the devs 1 introduce an option to stay indefinitely at one level only needing that fixed amount of xp to refill your hp with the ever increasing xp requirement eventually i wont be able to keep levelling up and will start dying and thatll be demotivating 2 make a holiday mode that has a different set of dailieshabits id like to have different goals on holiday
5,i am in the unique circumstance of liking to gamify my life and also being horrible at incentivizing doing daily chores this is literally the perfect app for me
5,so far i love this app and the idea behind it it holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love i would totally give it a shot
1,i moved to a new phone and cant restore my paid pro login so now im limited to the features of the free version
1,this app is really pretty annoying it said i didnt allow any permissions but it gave absolutely no further instruction so for a 199 i figured what do i have to lose well i have a lot of time to lose because i spent the money i now have the premium app i set the timer and i got the same message it says you have not set permissions but it gives no instruction as to how to set permissions and no button that i click works if it wasnt too much aggravation id be asking for a refund
1,heart breaking to see that even app allow list requires premium membership please try to help people out and we are ready to support you through ads i hope to receive a reply from the team
1,review update not sometimes now its frequently happening that i can close the forest app and bypass the whole purpose i can then use my phone to its full extent and forest is absolutely useless to me i will have to try some other app old review sometimes the app lets me open apps and get through the option to select 120 mins is great but they need to patch this bypass bug thats been happening im on a pixel 2xl
1,all the tree just got premium leading to less free content
1,i buyed new mobile and tried to login using it but wasnt able to do that i also tried by signing out other accounts but then also i couldnt look into it
1,i just want to restore my acc im just logged into it on my cell phone and i still cant
1,not able to restore my account in a new device very worst
1,it is a terrible app it always says forest has stopped workingi hate it dont download
1,i have already installed it but i cant see it in my computer i dont know what is wrong i installed it from google drive andi cant see anything in my computer if you can please tell me where can i find it  i would be so thankful
1,i have been facing an issue with the app for quite a few days now i stay on the app but my tree still dies and after that it still gives me the notification that my tree has grown so in essence i get neither my grown tree nor my coins even after i was on the app the whole time please fix this as otherwise the app is really cool
1,it often doesnt count exceeded time which makes me frustrated i already purchased premium and i regret it because of this problem
1,cant turn on deep focus mode
1,i had to uninstall the app since it didnt open and kept stopping when i reinstalled it all my progress and data was lost 
1,worst app ever whenever i open it the only thihg it does is stop
1,so disappointed with this app i purchased the pro version then i changed my phone i cannot log in my account they are asking me to purchase the pro version again i purchased the pro version again but im really really really disappointed i want a refund this so unfair
1,its not installing in my phone
1,在app内付费了两次没有升级到pro版本restore显示error且没有refundedi need my money back
1,erdfyg
1,poor service i purchased the premium version but i cant login again when i choose the login function the app always asks for redemption and has no function of filling in the account login
1,paid for the pro and im already annoyed i have several dead trees they want me to pay to get rid of just because i was canceling to fix the deep mode settings that you cannot turn on after you started but it doesnt even warn you its not on until you start so its an automatic failure you cant rid of dumbest and most easily avoidable issue
1,very useful app the only thing i wish you put on the app is a pause button or something to point different moments in the work block excelent app i bought the pro version cause is very accesible i wish you put more things to make this app the most incredible productivity app  edit i need help with the premium purchase i send an email and one person responded my email but the problem was not solved i want a refund please i like the app but this problem is a headache sorry 
1,nope not a good app i cant log in it ill find a better app
1,disappointed i have paid for the pro version due to space issues i had to delete this apphowever i reinstalled it now im not able to restore my pro version as an error occurs nor am i able to login to my account i have logged out of all other accounts as said in the error yet im unable to use the pro features its asking for payment again on top of that your support doesnt even care to reply already mailed them twice seems that you only care until your customer buys the pro version
1,i can not restore purchased i already follow the instruction and then send email but get no response
1,i paid for preminum version but they took the money twice out of my account and didnt even activate my version kindly do the needfull
1,após a última atualização ficou péssimo o app
1,a sloth is faster than this app literally
1,this app is so annoying i mean already bought the pro version and i am locked out of my account this app is a waste of time
1,i already have subscription but still im not able to login  everytime i click on login or signin ad for subscription comes up though ive 1year subscription this happened after i upgraded it to the newer version ive already paid for it please look into the matter
1,these people cant bring flora app to android as they consider ios are rich
1,todo era muy bonito hasta que pusieron todos los árboles guays en modo profesional los que conseguí hace tiempo con sudor y lágrimas me los van a quitar a final de año  mi vida ya no tiene sentido en esta app estaréis contentos
1,all beautiful plants are now in pro versionand for students like me whose parents wont allow me buy pro version this app is now not that good the update is very badi dont like it
1, scam alert  this is what happened i purchased the app few weeks ago it was great no issues in that then uninstalled it and reinstall it again the problem is it didnt log into my pro version account i contacted the support they asked me to do stuffs like clearing catches and other stuff but i realized the problem was in the app it didnt recognize me as a pro user and i have the proof of money transaction i mailed then couple of times but no reply i need my money
1,i want to love this app but every time i use it and every time i try to upgrade to premium i get an error 599 message tried factory resetting my phone even definitely a shame as i was looking for an app to recommend to my students
1,hey why is it so hard to log in to my account i need to restore my premium first to log in but the restore button isnt working now im stuck with the free features please fix your logging in interface
1,i paid for full version but im unable to restore after i reinstalledpls look into it
1,money wasting app
1,i update for new version but it cost money then dont say that this app is freeeee
1,i cannot log in myself to the app even though i just paid for it the restore button doesnt work it keep saying error my 100php is wasted
1,i had planted many trees and finally after a long time i was able to earn 500 coins and purchase the sound of night sky and also had around a 100 coins left out with me two days later the app automatically went back to the initial formlike the way it was when i first downloaded itand my hard earned night sky sound was gone and also the remaining coins approximately 100 coins were also gone psi did not change anything in the appthis app has glitch unhappy 
1,i was a big fan for the longest time but with the newest update uninstalled
1,it was good at first but then i dont how but they asked me to unlock the various trees and forcibly asked me to give them coin
1,great app until the update i really loved the app and accidently uninstalled it but then remembered and downloaded thinking back it was a great choice 
1,apps been goood helped me a lot free features have now been changed and are only available on pro mode
1,edit i am unable to restore my pro version back from the same account that i had purchased it i have sent mails to the premium support and to support forest im getting the same reply that login from the purchase account but i am trying to login from the same account from which it was purchased yet im unable to login i have shared the screenshot of the same in the mails please check and help me
1,i really liked this app until they started forcing me to upgrade to premium it asked me to update and i did turned out it was rhe worst decision ive made i saw the responses to other ratings like this and i understand why it was done but couldnt you keep some nice looking trees i really hope you consider this over and make some nice looking trees for the freeversion users i wont delete this app yet but if this doesnt improve it is almost guaranteed that i will delete this
1,pathetic update this is totally unfair i am gonna uninstall this app immediately
1,latest version 
1,i like tu use this program but when ever i open the app  it says  unfortunately  forest has been stoped and then it closed i dont know whats the problem and why
1,why is everything set to premium i am finding a open source version of this app
1,was a good app but now many species can be accessed only for pro users
1,it used to be great but now coins are useless since every cool looking tree is now behind a paywall
1,worst update ever
1,it wont let me restore my premium account same phone same google account
1,kinda sus that they made almost all of the trees and plants premium they really wanted people to go pro so that they can unlock new trees and plants this new update is honestly so unmotivating
1,its not the best option for beating distractions the makers of this app are extremely money minded
1,waste concept is good but it was not wroth paying premium
1,i wasnt able to login to my account actually im a pro customer its a bad experience
1,old version was much betterwhy were the beautiful plants were moved to pro version
1,not working at all
1,this app was very benificial at first but after you added almost every tree in premium version i lost my interest even after the update new tree added is not free this is sickening
1,i am not able to sign in in this app
1,attention can you add custom list of loud sounds endings of pomodoro app you app should interrupt me after end of pomodoro  but i dont hear anything
1,unable to get new trees store wont load error code 2903 error message asks to reply via inapp feedback system which dosent seem to be there in the settings plus faq and support page dosent open either have updated the app to the most recent version yet problem persists kindly resolve
1,i didnt like the upgrade i couldve had various kinds trees now i need to have the pro to get it 
1,just give an option to go back to the old version so unsatisfied and feel demotivated after the new update
1,it used to be a really great app but then the problem arrive it told me to update to latest version to see a new species but it was the worst update that could be ever made with the new update  most of the good looking tree species have now been reserved for those who have unlocked the paid version im really dissatisfied and disappointed cuz i have been using this app for the last two years 
1,mad game app
1,you cant unlock most of the trees until you pay for pro version
1,the app was very good before the update but now for everything they ask you to buy the pro version non pro users cant even buy new trees to plant its really a shame
1,been using this app for over a year it used to be great and many things were free but now they need you to pay money for half the content i have thousands of coins but since you need to buy with real money theres nothing to spend it on a lot more intrusive ads have surfaced when before it was optional to get extra coins yes we do notice these things been a disappointing downhill since its glory days but there are better apps now that do the exact same thing
1,sooo baad game
1,it keeps crushing down
1,my rating to this app just dropped from 5 to 1 mainly because of this companys marketing strategy on how to pressure someone or the previous users to buy their pro version there were many beautiful trees in store where you can purchase for free with free version now its only possible by having the pro version its quite disappointing that this app doesnt allow you to feel motivated and pull you down by offering their worst trees masterpiece i wont give my 5  till this issue fixed
1,amazing app for concentration and motivation would really appreciate it if there is an auto pomodoro function ie 5 min and 15 min breaks between 25 mins of work would seriously consider buying the pro version if it is available edit instead of improving functionality to incentivize users to buy the premium version they paywalled most of the trees kinda beats the purpose since theres no incentive anymore
1,opened my app today just to see that almost all of the trees and plants are now behind a paywall i understand the reasoning behind this decision but its disheartening to see especially since ive been saving up for wisteria for so long and now just cant access it i dont use this app often enough to justify purchasing the premium guess ill just look into other apps like everyone else then
1,unable to downloadits already showing downloaded but its not downloaded in my phone
1,this 1star is for new updated versionprev bersion was beautiful but new one sucks it doesnt count time if phone is in battery savings mode
1,welli have started today onlyso later i will explain it
1,i give one star because i dont like this app because it like a mobile timer  in my mobile already timer
1,cant even reset my password because every single time i get an error occured
1,the attracting feature of this app were the variety of trees this was also an incentive to study more as that if you used the app correctly was the only way to unlock new tree species youve taken this feature away for most users and kept a few bland trees as an obvious tactic to boost purchases which is annoying whats even more annoying is the disingenuous replies of pirated software 09092020 response was going to give a 2 or 3 since its now just an average app but now a 1
1,i hated the update all the beautiful trees are now in the premium suction it was way fun when i was able to choose what ever tree i want and buy it with the money that i earned from the time that spent focusing now im earning money for nothing like whats the point 
1,helpful in staying on task or to not use my phone so much in distracting or unhelpful ways concern is that i was trying to get trees and now just today i noticed that certain species are no longer available disappointing edit a lot of users are also finding it unfair that you took away an exciting part of the app us regular non premium users are very disappointed change it back please stop generating automatic responses edit 2 just as suspected an auto response no action
1,all those nice features it says you can use they sound pretty great dont they only problem is you have to pay for them like all of them yeah its free you just have to buy the premium version to do literals anything i was excited for this im certainly disappointed
1,very bad decision doing that the most of the trees became a pro version for this reason i uninstalled it
1,app is not opening in my phone what may be the problem i love to try this app please help me out 
1,awesome app but developer is chinese boycott china we want made in india app
1,not working properly for me  the app crashes everytime i open it which is so stressfull  im running on a andriod 444 which the devs claim that is supported although it litterally crashes as i open it
1,not so good app
1,im lowering bcs of the now update i find an awful decision to block most trees under pro as other users have pointed it takes most of the fun away from free users i was very excited to rebuy some trees from other times i had the app but now i cant ill be uninstalling the app
1,its a very bad app because i changed the settings too  but the tree  would die everytime if i opened another app or turned off my phone
1,its not working on my tablet huawei t17plz solve this sooni rate it 5 bcz its helping the environmentnow i change it
1,without buying pro version u cant enjoy this spp
1,i would give 5 star before the last update i used to do hard work for those expensive plantsnow i think i will uninstall the app son
1,everyones hungry for money and so is younow i cant even plant those trees which i have already unlockedkeep your app dont need this nowuninstalling
1,i purchased a big bag of time crystals on 28th of september i sent a complaint because i was not able to redeem said purchase because there was some kind of error the response team said they were on vacation until 5 october so i was patient with them it is already 10 october and i already asked for multiple follow ups and still no resolution redeem or just reimburse me of my problem how long does it take for you to fix this ive paid actual money for this i love the app but response 
1,it doesnt work for me it always get out of the app
1,support tablet landscape mode please uninstalled
1,the main aim of the app is to maintain focus while we are doing any work and hence it should provide app locks during our work but that app provide these feature to only paid members which is not bad but i think you should provide some main feature to free members also which will satisfy our wish of focusing you can provide some additional features to paid members but to lock app is just main aspect you should provide it for alll
1,the app is crashing everytime i open in my mi pad android kitkat 442 device even unable to submit bug report as well
1,error code 600 when i try to insert a friend code
1,since the latest update where you now always have to assign a tag i will choose one because i have to now and then when i check on my timer a while later the app will have changed the tag to something else for some reason
1,i cant believe the majority of the trees were moved to premium users only ive been using this app for years and have watched tons of adds ill be looking for a new productivity app now that there is a ridiculous pay wall to use the different tree species
1,i used to like this app and have motivation to actually use it collect coins and buy new species of trees but now all the cool stuff is only available in the paid version disappointed upd stop with this pirated software bs you did it because youre greedy little devs unfortunately you will only lose customers instead of making money through ads how sad
1,not at all satisfied about new update cannot unlock beautiful trees without pro version searching for similar apps and uninstall as soon as i find it
1,why cant we edit the tags rubbish gold diggers
1,why did all the trees have to be in the pro version it was not like that before this just makes the app so focused on money this sucks
1,i cannot recover my vip purchase
1,disappointed me when asked for money  
1,with the recent update i lost all coins and all my unlocked trees and now i find that all the trees i had unlocked are blocked for the pro version not impressed will be uninstalling this app
1,really great app that works very well unfortunately i have to give one star because of the poor customer service i would love to purchase the pro version but i was having issues so i reached out months ago and there was no response please fix this i would like to support your app but this is not good at all
1,its just not fair i have been using this app for years i cant buy the pro version because of the country where i live in iran you just took everything away from the non pro users i used to love this app but i see no respect deleted it sure looking for some other app
1,disappointing every tree that i wanted is in a pro version this used to be my favorite app
1,i cant focus if my plant keeps dying 
1,all was well until the developers literally forcing me to upgrade to the premium version i understand that everything cant be for free but the numerous advertisements which i watched since last 2 years didnt generate any revenue the trees which i bought with my coins went all into the premium version and now they are saying that i cant plant them until i upgrade what the poppycock is this without much ado let me move on and get a new productive app
1,why all the trees in pro version  they were free before now i cant have those plants change it change it now
1,very boring and irritating app unusually robbering people truely the new update is worst
1,loved this app until a lot of the trees were placed behind a paywall there are similar apps out there without this feature
1,b ad
1,i love this app but after the last update it wont work at all 
1,not working keeps force exit the app
1,it doesnt work anymore
1,the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone edit there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs dont care listen to the users
1,used to love this app but i got a new phone pixel 4a and its all screwed up now it wont let me restore my purchases and the buttons are misaligned so the back button is hidden under the camera i get stuck and have to close the app to exit the screen really disappointing
1,it is extremely disappointing that most of the trees now fall under the pro version and the developer is basically forcing the free users to buy the pro version and pay money and its not like i didnt contribute to this applications revenue since ive watched thousands of advertisements over the past few years so this new update is really frustrating whats the point of allowing people to download it for free if you are just going to restrict it so much and take away so many features
1,i already bought this app a year ago i just got a new phone and it keeps on pushing me to buy premium when ive already bought it logging will also push you to buy the premium ive tried to click forget password but it send the email very late
1,i am highly disappointed by the latest version of this app all the beautiful tree species have been limited to pro version and i dont find any reason to let this app be in my phone probably going to delete in few days 
1,i really love this app as it really helps my focus on my work but the recent update took away all of my motivation to collect coins to buy new species of trees im not a premium user and not being able to collect all of the species makes me very sad
1,it used to be great but ever since it updated it doesnt work and it lets me go onto other apps while in use which defeats the purpose of the app i was going to upgrade to premium but now that its not working i dont dare risk it if even the basic features dont work then i doubt that the premium ones will
1,this is the worst app ever my password was breached and my information may have been leaked to third parties it wont let me delete my account or even change my password you should be ashamed that you made an app that takes peoples information like this and then you dont have the courtesy to give them the option to delete their account literally the worst get yourselves sorted
1,for a producticity app they sure are unproductive i sent them messages regarding some glitches in my app four months later no followups no solutions
1,why did you take away the option to unlock trees with coins thats dumb edit ive read your reply and believe that better services were not provided and operations were not improved
1,whats the problem i dont like it coz it always says that the game has stooped u nfortunatelly
1,awesome app really motivates to ditch the phone but i just purchased premium and the app didnt get updated it says your payment was cancelled even when the amount is deducted and the bank showed payment successful did i just waste my money please solve this problem i have the latest version of the app its up to date i also wrote a mail but there has been no reply till now
1,force closing after recent update on all samsung devices
1,very very bad
1,dont know what they did but this app doesnt work on my android 10 device anymore lags for ages then just stops working and shuts down not helpful now my forest wont grow and will become neglected because i am uninstalling this app next and i doubt ill ever use it again
1,this is worst appsingle star dena majboori thnhi to wo bh n detamera premium ke liye 129 rupees pay ho gya aur yha pe premium bh nhi milaye log bina login ke payment krate hto kya proof h ki kisne payment kithis is worst app dont pay
1,i was thinking about buying the pro version when i have the availability of all the trees for the other benefits but at the very end they put all the good trees in pro version kind of forcing me to buy it that sucks and makes this app good for nothing
1,too many ads find another alternatve with no ads or at least not as many
1,hearing other peoples experiences really ruins the app for me im a pro user i didnt know that all the trees were behind a pay wall now but to make that change its really disappointing it takes away all the fun all the hard work people have made to buy trees and you guys dont care you just copy and paste the same trashy response i honestly dont think that putting everything behind a pay wall will prevent pirated software wont people want to pirate it more when the fun is gone
1,fazol app
1,premium should be free
1,when i downloaded it is coming fail to try
1,dear forest as a loyal user im deeply disappointed in your current business tactics it seems your team has not understood how to go about this perhaps you need to consult with someone cuz youre not only frustrating potential new customers but also old ones i cant believe every feature for new users is blocked how am i supposed to get someone to purchase when they cant experience the app ive unlocked every tree have 16k coins  feel betrayed by this new referral nonsense get help
1,everything was great until developers started literally pushing me to buy a premium version now i found out that all cool designed trees are moved to premium versionsorry not sorryyet there should be a little piece of respect towards your loyal customers who have been using these app for years personally ive been using it since 2017 i understand that there couldnt be everything for free but still you could keep at least some nice options for other users im so sad yet i will delete it
1,everything is locked in premium no use for basic version
1,its not even opening  this dont deserve even one star this is just a wastage of time and data 
1,i am not able to login kn my account i have a pro subscription please help
1,i am not able to log in theres not option to log in they ask to register again
1,after september update its annoying
1,im a premium memberafter updating im unable to get that pear tree housepls look into this issue
1,the app is not working on my phone it keeps crashing ive complained multiple times ive also sent emails detailing all the problems but i havent gotten a single reply this started as soon as i bought the premium version of the app
1,cant restore in app purchases so i paid again the pro version then my trees didnt come back after signing in my account can you fix this
1,i liked this app this is verry nice aap
1,used to be great until they became too pushy to upgrade to the paid version now you need to be on the pro version to buy designer trees as compared to the early days where you could just purchase them even on the free version quite disappointed with the development team frankly
1,i dont know whats go in on cause from yesterday my forest it doesnt work im so sad cause i love this app please fix it
1,doesnt really work for me personally you might feel it differently however
1,wow
1,app just sucks and dont say you made changes to prevent piracy thats just a pathetic excuse this is just a blatant money grab you fools are pathetic get a damn life losers revert this app back to what it used to be and you will find people coming back in droves until then just watch them all leave
1,horrible update
1,very good app for students
1,i really liked it until the new pro version update
1,it should be free for all and focused defined
1,i bought premium and reset my phone and i cant get my pro account anymore can yall fix that or something
1,why everytime i try to login to my account the software ask me repurchase right now i am unable to login to my purchased software
1,it was a good app i made premium purchase yesterday and unknowingly cleared my data today now i cant login and asking me to buy again please look into this many of my friends facing the same issue please make login a feature in the app 
1,lost my premium account due to a recent update  the app kept crashing  hence i uninstalled the app and reinstalled it again ever since then im unable to recover my premium account and have lost all the special trees data about my studying hours and basically everything i have tried contacting the company through mail no response wow  that is not the response a customer would expect when he is robbed off the app he just purchased no reply for the mail either people dont buy this sham
1,why do you lock everything in new updates i used to love this app but im uninstall it
1,multiple times they showed that coins doubled after rewarded ad but in reality only half the amount would be added what a trick to get your sponsors their target and fool us didnt expect this
1,it is useless even after planting the tree app does not stop me
1,i bought the pro version however it doesnt unlock the tree specieswhy is that
1,i really loved this app i used it regularly and planting my forest really motivated me to keep going on unfortunately from the september update on almost all trees are behind a pay wall now i understand you cannot do everything for free but the trees should at least be available for coins you can earn for using this app im not sure if you are really reading this but you dont have to copy and paste your standard answer to my comment as well you already did it to a bunch of others
1,its a bit pathetic that rather than adding new features to encourage people to switch to a paid version features have been removed to make the free version less appealing the number of trees available to purchase no matter how many ads you watch is now nothing compared to the past
1,i liked the app so paid for the premium edition however it doesnt let me log in on my primary phone the login screen keeps sending me to new purchase page instead of actually giving me a login both my devices are android phones disappointed
1,this app does not notify me when the pomodoro is done i just end up working for an hour or two useless
1,this used to be a great app but the quality has gone down over time
1,i was using this quite a bit but now ill lose trees about half the time from things like notifications from android manager voicemail notifications etc and it wont let me add any of the phones system apps to my white list edit ive reduced to one star after getting a new phone was unable to switch with this app and lost all my progress also so many features are pay walled now i cant even have a white list anymore unless i pay
1,i found a replacement for you now and i am very happy  its the study bunny app and has all the features which your pro version has in free  uninstalling this app 
1,i have purchase pro mode but my little sister accidentally uninstall it and now i cant login again because i had to purchase it again i cant even restore it please fix it so i can login again please
1,its very bad
1,help when i try to log back into my pro account when i press restore it wont let me saying to use my original google account and log out of my other ones when i never changed my google account at all
1,ever since the update i been unable to log in to my account despite only having the account i purchased the premium and cant even do forget password as it wont send me an email and seriously whats the point now with the new updates small trees size and look bland this used to be good
1,it doesnt work on multiple devices
1,it would be 5 star but 1 star for you dammm new update which is purchasing plants
1,it doesnt guide me back when i leave the app
1,i used to enjoy this app but with the most recent update i have no more incentive in using this app because theres basically no more trees that k can buy without paying for the pro version ill be looking for another app to use instead of this one
1,got much worse after update i lost all my paid trees that i had purchased i am looted return my species
1,just purchase pro version cant sync through my devices cant restore purchase also totally scam ps already tried your suggestion and not working i purchase other app before  not have any problem even i use many phone
1,फरज
1,i used to give this app a 5 star rating before the new update it used to be such a fun and helpful app to keep people motivated by letting them collect all those pretty trees now nonpro users barely have any trees to choose from i was planning to do themed gardens each month i guess now thats down the drain
1,loved the app was saving in game currency for a weeping willow that was listed as free only needed 100 more coins to purchase it but with the recent update almost 60 of trees have turned to premiumthroughly disappointed
1,not able to understand how to use this productive app
1,app used to be great until the update   please consider making some trees free again for free users i really miss enjoying this app i understand how they need the money but they didnt have to cause such an inconvenience to the free users by leaving them without any good stuff  edit seriously an automatic reply shows how much yall cared disgusting
1,i bought the pro version and now i am not able to login again everytime its asking me to signup again and for that you have to buy the pro version again i dont know is this is the problem with the latest update but i am not getting option to login
2,their should be alarm type sound when we complete some task
2,extremely frustrating that the free version has been stripmined and had pretty much all content locked behind the premium wall im really fond of the app and its functionality but its very discouraging to have had the fun aspects removed from the base version
2,earlier this app used to have a large varieties of trees available which could be bought by the coins that you collected from your study sessions but now all those varieties of tree species can be unlocked only after buying their pro version so there isnt really much use left of the app if you dont want to get the pro version
2,initially it was a very great experience with this app but nowadays the app suddenly gets closed and the tree gets dead
2,this program has gotten worse by updating this is not acceptable
2,no real objective i dont see the difference from a simple timer the app is still good but you cant really look at your forest and say wow and get motivated i think this app doesnt keep its promises  also i have no sound so i dont know when the timer goes off which does not do the job it works for others people tho
2,i think that forest is so good
2,i bought the app  but when i change the handset it is failing to restore the pro version it is very annoying
2,i left the app and my tree still didnt die lol like i could still use twitter instagram etc
2,this app has big issues it allows other apps to be used even though they have been restricted from use during a tree planting this is despite blocking those apps in the allow list it kept crushing so i uninstalled it and put it back on all my progress from when i started planting trees was lost and i use a pro version one should be able to recover those planted trees surely after all im using the pro version 
2,used to like this app alot but now i have less motivation in earning coins since i have to get premium to get the trees i want  saw the developers reply in others alike review but i hope they make an effort to create trees that compensate the update
2,this is good app but very stick app i give 2 star because little little i dont understand this app
2,i dont mind giving pro users some advantages but this is too much way too many tree species need to be unlocked with money now and i looked forward to unlocking them i was even thinking of buying the premium but after this update i dont want to anymore very dissapointed
2,the app keeps hanging  i have to uninstall and then reinstall it once every 34 days please fix the bug
2,i did love the forest app until the recent update i hardly ever update my apps now its not possible to buy new trees they are only available for pro users and not with coins lame super lame
2,totally a black screen coming when ever we are trying to watch an ad to double up coins plz fix this issue
2,hi can you please add pershian language  so you mean you can not add pershian language  some of our people are use your app to and please add a stop feature to your app so that in the moments when something happens to us we can stop and not think that we were reading the whole time we had planned doing the useful work so that our trees would grow more fully tanks 
2,we need an alarm tone after timer  is done  premium user i often went over time because i dont notice my tree has already grown i turn off the bg music cuz its distracting for me i prefer piano music the excess time i went over could have been used to grow more trees pls add an alarm tone thank you
2,does everything the app says and its good however you cannot restore your pro version no matter how much you try once you log out your account is good as gone dont buy the pro version until they fix it
2,bought premium on one device which worked well have recently changed device but am unable to login due to a popup asking to pay for premium edit the new device is also android i ended up rebuying premium
2,absolutely loved this app when i first got it after the new update im very disappointed to see that most of the content is locked for non pro users i had an entire plan for which trees i still wanted to get and the newest species looks awesome but now i have to pay to unlock it the little trees were my number 1 motivation to use this app and get my work done in the first place now i cant even do that
2,initially i liked the apk  but later many times the time was not counted phubing i am really disappointed bcoz i purchased the apk to early without knowing this glitch
2,the last update is soooo wrong im losing my hours
2,i didnt like it
2,i really loved this app but im not happy with new version at all it was motivational for me to focus more gain more coins and buy expensive trees but now you have omitted all of the interesting species for free version and it is not enjoyable for me any more i live in iran so i can not purchase the pro version and i am pretty sure im not alone in this i hope you find away to get back everything to normal cause i am definitly in love with this app
2,i really liked it at first and one of the main reasons that attract me was the beautiful trees and now free users can only have limited trees and i dont even like one of them so im removing this from my favourite app list time to find another one im really disappointed
2,it take to much time
2,i was genuinely considering buying the pro version because i really liked this app but the latest update made a bunch of the trees premium only and i had just saved enough coins to buy another and now i cant get one of the ones i wanted and im very angry so now i dont want to anymore
2,this app has definitely helped me put my phone down but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards after using it for six months ive run out of trees and plants to purchase so theres not much more to add to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins when i get a new phone i wasnt able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before
2,helps me focus greatly but i cant connect to my other devices i bought the app with my ipad but i cant log in through my android phone to access any of the data or my trees
2,i used to love this app it felt really rewarding to have focused long enough to buy a cool new plant youve been saving up for now those trees are locked behind a premium wall theyre charging you for content they offered for free before it seems like theyre taking advantage of their users and charging money for an app catered towards helping broke college students study seems wrong especially during such hard economic and social times im a long time user offering 2 stars
2,used to be a good app now it is limited students dont have that much to pay for every app they use
2,nothing interesting unless you get premium  at least let us buy trees by watching some ads
2,time to find another app the pro version is really good and i understand it is needed to provide good services but there are plenty of other versions rather than making only 10 trees available for free version users put more adds add inapp purchase to purchase like coins or an upgraded coins like every game app do make special tree more expensive in coins this update really kills the appeal of this app
2,im writing this review while my tree is growing i cant turn on the android focus mode but facebook works fine so what is the point of this app ive enabled all the permissions but it doesnt block chrome or facebook
2,used to love the app they make you give phone access to be in leader boards and buy premium for interesting trees i understand they are worried about pirated software but they are sacrificing their user base in exchange
2,app is very useful but most fun part  planting trees is annoying there are very few species available even though i bought premium i still need to focus approximately 4000 minutes just to buy 1 2k tree another feature i would like to have is arranging my forest as i want currently trees appear randomly
2,i have been using forest for a few years now and i have switched to an iphone 11 now but they are asking me to purchase the app to access it the app is free on android so should i pay for applestore
2,app is really good at a time but after the last few updates you made everything premium we cant even buy new tree species that looks good thats boreing to plant same kinda trees everyday  then what can we do with in game money if we cant buy any of them what are you trying to do you will loose too many of users by doing these kinda things so please do something with this stuff please its a request please reply if you agree
2,1 if i want to be in leaderboard i need to give the app permission to all of my private things no thanks 2 the achievements always show theres a new achievement unlocked but theres actually none this bug is often fixed and then reappears which is annoying otherwise the app is alright lots of bugs but they get fixed fast the part i hate most is the privacy issue because i used to be encouraged by the leaderboard but im not going to give an app such access sad i miss the feature
2,it keeps closing the app
2,i enable those options but when i close the program completely i can still enter other programs please help
2,i loved it great concept but i need a calendar and planner too
2,its a good application overall but the thing which i remember came with an update the trees you can not plant all of them thats the reason why i am giving two stars trees make it more interesting and what made the application with pay to plant is bad
2,love it but had to leave a review bcz of the policy so that i can get that lovely free plant
2,so far good it would be really good if the developers added a pause function to the app so that if something comes up during your study or focus period you can easily pause and come back to where you left of as the time is just going when other things come into focus
2,what is 599 error it just stop me using this app hate that
2,it seems your pro app for most android user has error 600 when they use referral codes for friend invitation i hope you fix it as soon as you can
2,hi even when the deep focus mode is on i am still able to go to different apps and at same time my trees are also growing i saw a youtube video od 20 minites and meanwhilemy 15 minute grew completely i am 100 sure that deep focus mode was on as it told me in the app u should check on that
2,feelings disappointed bcs i paid for nothing you shouldve let the premium user get at least 5 or more new trees it was such a large amount of money just for a tree and some little feature
2,this app used to be the app i rely on everyday to focus on my studies but after the recent update users are literally forced to upgrade to premium to unlock a variety of tress i understand that the organisation needs some sort of income but still to make most 80of the trees unavailable to free users i am utterly disappointed
2,reducing my rating because after their new update you cannot unlock most of the trees unless you upgrade to premium really affects the experience
2,entiendo que todos debemos ganar dinero y que tal vez la situación no está fácil para nadie sin embargo se podrían poner más anuncios y dejar más opciones de diferentes árboles para quienes no somos premium lo emocionante de la app consistía en concentrarse más seguido para ganar monedas y así comprar el árbol para el que ahorrarás ahora con las limitaciones ya lo es emocionante igual es muy funcional pero era mejor en todo caso es entendible y respetable las nuevas actualizaciones
2,this app was good until i purchased the pro version i was saving up coins to buy a 2k tree when i was finally able to buy it the system keeps on saying that i did not have enough coins i tried buying a 600 coin tree and suddenly my coin went down to 500 from 2k to 500 and i only bought a 600 coin tree it happened twice already and this is frustrating
2,the most inconvenience i have faced is that the notification sound is not even audible after the tree has completely planted this make me even more distracted to keep checking on this hope forest will take this issue into serious consideration as i was so disappointed by this bug after i have purchased the pro version
2,pay money for tree  
2,i really enjoyed using this app until the september update forced all free users behind a paywall with just a few basic options in consideration of the pandemic and many folks enjoy the simplicity of this focus app while getting a handle on their own lives i disagree with the decision of this move i am not sure what to do with the coins earned since i have all the basic options
2,since the update i am not able to open the store
2,cant log in after an uninstall when i press log in i get a pro pop up but i already have pro just let me log in furthermore it just gives me an error when i try to restore purchase incredibly disappointed loved the app but now i feel robbed please fix
2,had this app for about 2 years i had earned almost 5000 points i got a new phone and everything i had is gone i have the same number and my email addresses are all synced but none of my earnings or unlocks are here i feel sort of reluctant to use it now
2,there should be a notification once you are done with your task itll help please update this thing in it a notification a beep or any sound please
2,drain phone battery when not using it
2,until recent update it was a 5 star if you bring changes make sure your customer services are reponsive too at that time the friendship redeem option didnt appear in settings after update so i reinstalled same devicenow i cant restore at all error says sign out of other accounts i use only one email and i will not factory reset my phone for one app dont go blind over money i really want to help plant trees now everything looks like money grab
2,i use the app for years on my iphone and laptop and i love everything about it however i purchased a tablet lately i downloaded forest and when i try to log in theres nothing but the proversion ad sadly i cant use my account
2,this app nothing help in focused because i start this app timer after that i can easily open any app but the timer going on continuosly the tree cannot shrink please fix this problem after than this app rate 5 stars
2,even after ive enabled deep focus i can use apps that are not in the allowed list sometimes the blocking of apps doesnt work
2,good job
2,looks cool but i had to uninstall the app because it wont go to sd storage
2,i wanted to like it but many dealbreakers no alarm at end of session no way to automatically go between breaks and work sessions no way to automatically alternate between short and long breaks no way to customize alarms that signify end of session contacted premium support re no alarm no response also when you enter your birthday to register for premium its in a calendar form its much easier to enter a birthday by typing mmddyyyy or to use a drag down menu for m d and year
2,so disappointed i love this app and its made my study life so much better i used to recommend it to everyone just when i save up enough coins to buy the maple tree i want i go to the store and the app has updated making 90 of all the trees except plain grass offered only for premium subscription super disappointing because i love the app but im not paying 3 just to get a virtual maple tree smh
2,stupid premium upgraded version for planting trees  not fair 
2,the new update was ridiculous i have tried so hard to get enough money for my favorite trees but they had been moved to pro version as no more motivation i have i uninstall this app
2,cannot login to my pro version after reformatting my phone 
2,hey i am unable to restore purchase on a new phone is there anything i can do because there is an error after i clicked restore purchase
2,i live in irani cant use the app because of payment problems  i have to uninstall it
2,the new update is worse i used to love it but the new interface is not at all good almost 60 of the trees are now in the pro version which leave almost nothing for the non pro version users and the trees look very small which selection in the new layout previously it was good i hope all these shall be rectified in the later versions
2,the new update is really disappointing i was truly enjoying the app and watching my forest grow
2,i like the concept and have found a lot of utility out of the free version i bought the pro version for 199 to show gratitude but now i cant double the amount of in game currency i earn by watching an ad you use the in game currency to buy different types of plants and with pro most plants are almost 10x the price so with pro you earn 50 in game currency and need 10x to buy most plants thats 20x the time seems like a shameless way to try and hawk micro purchases of in game currency
2,this used to be such a great app but since the new update we cannot purchase new species of trees additional to that the promotional adds have increased the ios users arent paying a single penny extra for anything either pro version or having a group timer even all the species are available this is not done you have snatched the mere basic content of the app from android users
2,la aplicación no da ninguna notificación posterior al tiempo que seleccione por lo que no sé realmente cuanto tiempo he estado estudiando ni sé manejar mis tiempos de descanso ya realice los pasos sugeridos por la aplicación y aún así no me notifica nada mi celular es huawei no sé si esa sea la razón
2,i love this app and would have happily given it five stars or more but all the trees ive unlocked were relocked and im very unhappy ive always had the pro version i should have my trees
2,there is some problem it no longer gives me warning and redirects me back to forest when i use some other app
2,i wish i could set 4 to 5 hours at a time and i hate those ads popping up whenever i open the app
2,agak sedih karena ada yang berbayar dan fiturnya sedikit tapi enak sih buat ngatur waktu doang mah
2,just stay off your phone 
2,i now have a strong dislike for this app ive had it for a little while now but the fact that i now have to pay for pro for most of the trees is ridiculous it was fine before why do these app developers mess things up like this
2,guys what the hell is pro version i collected coins to buy the 2k tree but now i cant m giving u two stars cz i aced in my exam cz of this app but the pro version is really disappointing
2,i request the seekrtech team to please add some tree species to the free version please it is a humble request 
2,edit ive had his app for a long time i was here back when the app whitelist was a free feature in the latest update the free version is much more limited and free users cant even buy all the trees anymore its frustrating to see all the good features of this app being hidden away i understand new updates like the detailed stats and planting with friends being exclusive to the pro version or making newer trees exclusive but please give the old trees back
2,i would like to see different colours of trees depending on what their tag is eg study rest entertainment etc so that i know how exactly i spent my time with just one look
2,incredibly disappointed with the new update this app used to be visually pleasing because of the vast variety of trees but now you have to pay for every good aspect of this app while i understand the developers need and deserve money there is a limit
2,basically if you dont have the pro version you cant use 90 of the app such a good app but you have to pay for each and every new options for studying like pie chart trackers no good
2,this app is really very good but im disappointed with the new update majority of the tress have been added to the pro version i happily updated to see if any new species is added  i recommended it to many of my friends  but im seriously very disappointed
2,i realy like this app rhe thing is that you only can buy some specific trees and for the others you need the pro version and befor you just can buy more trees
2,this app has become more and more money driven as someone who has been using this for years and across multiple devices this is really disappointing more and more features that used to be free are being locked behind a paywall hopefully someone comes out with a similar app because the concept is good but now everyth needs to be paid for
2,sad that the feature of being able to pick which apps can be blocked are for the pro version only  as well as many of the other tree species  ive saved up some coins to be able to buy one of the more expensive ones but now i wont be able to unless i buy pro which is a shame  what species left for the free version is also very few now  not as fun to use this app now but i guess i understand the need for money
2,i loved this app and there was so much to look forward to until i got limited to 7 trees and everything that actually getting me excited to work harder just got locked i can understand the reason for making the pro version better but i dont see why u had to make the free version borderline useless to do that
2,it say over 25 mil downloads and there are only 10 mil downloads
2,they just had to lock away half of the unlockable trees it was hard earning coins day by day hoping one day to unlock all trees frequently id watch ads to double the coins ill earn but now since they locked them up for good i guess this coins of mine are only good for deleting my record for dying trees
2,i hate how i now have to get the pro version to plant the trees that i like maybe give more trees in the free version or give more veriety the nine free ones dont really give me motivation to finish anything
2,who would want to continue using the app for free with such limited trees i guess this app isnt student friendly such a shame it was really a big help to me its sad to finally uninstall after a long time of use
2,the ads dont always give you double coins bc there are some you cant close and they just loop when theyre done so the only thing you can do is close the app and then you dont get double coins edit bug is mostly fixed the way to opt out of the second ad now appears after 5 seconds unfortunately the update locked most of the unlockable tree species behind a paywall so the app just got a whole lot less interesting for me 
2,quite disappointed after the recent updates you are trying to monetize everything you may end up loosing your worthy and loyal customers by this predatory approach
2,what motivated me to keep using the app was collecting coins to unlock different trees now to unlock must of them is not enough to collect coins now you have to have the pro version i was earning to get the sunflowers why why ill have to found another app also i dont think its ok to only plant trees in real life only having the pro version  use ecosia browser instead not sponsored and stop monopolizing our planets health
2,i used to love this app but im disappointed with the new update that has so limited free tree selection please fix that
2,băgați și limba română
2,i liked it before the new update 
2,era bom até atualizarem e você ser obrigado a pagar para desbloquear outras plantas 
2,he ha
2,i used to love working with this aoo and it was helpful but the recent update is frustrating it sounds vast inequality among your paid and unpaid users and it seems foolish to paid only for some species while you can get other effective apps for free mu aim is to upgrade my focus not to buy trees so really upset for this unfriendly update and yes uninstalling it
2,i am really unhappy  with this app now i was working hard to buy a new tree and now you have converted all into pro version irrespective of thinking of people who cant afford
2,its a good app to block your phone if you want to focus for some time the thing is it is not as good if what you want is to stop overusing your phone altogether also the last change of moving certain tree species most of them almost all to premium is kind of lame since so many functions are already only available for premium accounts couple that with how much time it takes to get a tree and this change seems unnecessary since use time also means more adds watched and more revenue
2,the last updated is so bad  i used to use forest about 2y and now i uninstall it im so sad cuz its been like my friend and do help me alot in terms of studying i cant buy the pro version bye bye forest 
2,i really dont like the new updateall the trees are locked and you need to buy the pro version to unlocked it
2,id give it five stars but the last update ruined it for me i was collecting coins to purchase more trees but since almost all trees are locked now i lack the motivation to use it
2,he guys
2,i tried a couple of time but still cant install it i tried other apps and they are ok
2,i used to love this app and use it always but why have you made all of the special trees only for pro users i used to continue planting trees to earn coins for new trees but now my coins are for nothing
2,my app updated and now almost all the tree options are locked behind a pay wall this is such a disappointment when ive been saving up my coins not a fan uninstalled
2,the latest upgrade is so mean you couldve added all the upcoming trees for the pro version gradually but almost all old trees are now for pro seriously 
2,the app is really cool but now almost everything is going to be premium just make it a pay app
2,i used to love this app unfortunately the new update took away the features i liked the most unless you pay for premium used to be free the app white list is now premium only as are many of the trees i used to have before getting a new phone very disappointed will need to find a new app
2,it worked well initially  but then started crashing each time i opened it i reintalled it and it was working fine for the first week  but then again crashed  everytime it crashed all my progress was lost
2,app keeps crashing edit app is working fine now 5 stars  edit 2 crashing again have to uninstall and reinstall to make it work
2,whatttt this app is connected to my other account and im not able to change it i cant pay right now for the pro version because its connected to a different account how do i solve thisss help  the app is nice and i need the pro version 
2,the controls dont work sometimes
2,great concept until i noticed how intrusive this app is in monitoring user activity
2,i was super excited to use this app as it was the only one of its kind i could find that allowed me to choose apps i could still use as a collage student who uses a timetable app this sounded really useful but then i found out that this feature is locked behind a paywall every other prenium feature is fine as prenium but i cannot get behind this one being locked ill have to find another app
2,isnt really helpful because one can tap on the home button and continue using phone while the tree is still growing
2,app is great for f9cusing and keeping track of how much time i have saved from social media but every time an uodate comes from samsung galaxy store app stops working i have to uninstall and install again from play store please fix this issue it is annoying
2,the app is getting crashed please fix it
2,seema pant i think this app is useful but in this app we have to pay also but its an nice app
2,i like the app a lot but the app keeps crashing within a week of installing i have to reinstall again to use the app please fix this
2,the app keeps crashing on me
2,keeps on crashing 
2,i am facing problem from the past month whenever i click on forest option to view my forest it shows that i had planted 0 trees but i had planted nearly 100 treez after refreshing 10 times that to back button behaves as refresh button i could see my forest
2,i paid for the premium version now it asks for crazy intrusive permissions just to function properly
2,the app interface is pretty good but alot of bots if you check global settings so it doesnt give a realistic feel if you are checking or comparing yourself it would be great if they can verify user status 
2,bekar experinceafter 12hour there is a crash in app
2,awesome increase ur productivity
2,not what i was looking for
2,you can off the closing app  beside it has time for dont use it didnt say how much do you use you phone  nothing  but you can off your phone up to 120min  only
2,it has a ckiche everytime i try to open the app it closes i have to uninstall to get back to the app
2,hey actually its the best app for productivity however every other day it keeps getting crashed and i have to reinstall the app again the next day please fix this issue at the earliest
2,i would have given 5 stars but this application crashes a lot due to this we have to reinstall the app and all our achievements are lost kindly look into this
2,idk if it only happens to me if you do not apply for the premium membership my app gets crashed and it does not open but other times it is really halpful 
2,its really nice app for making us focused but every day it doesnt opens and all my data goes ad every day i have to install uninstall very annoying now fed up plzz fix it as fast as u can getting so much irritated what d hell yar every two days this app is geting crash and doesnt open just tell wwhat to do such a headache am fed up its notgetting right this is 6th time i have been installing becoz it works three days and fourth day doesnt opens updating also done then alsoissuenotsolve
2,the app is great except that after the update it stopped working i lost most of my data i really love it so i gave it one more try and reinstall it then it stopped working i reinstalled 3 times and it still stopped working i was really mad the app idea is great but why the programming so bad
2,it was really good at first and i loved it but then the app was not working properly so i had to uninstall it
2,it worked properly once later its asking to upgrade and app is not opening rest the features and everything is good
2,one more feature should be added with extra is that there should be a timer becoz sometimes some important works comes in middle of the time set by us  if we just start a timer then exactly how much we work that can be recorded as we dont want tree dead  this feat should be added additionally with the existing feature
2,i got pro version app worked fine for 4 days but now its crashing a lot again n again need to reinstall and there is no guarantee that i will login in 1 try you need to fix this
2,app keeps on crashing while starting
2,i had to uninstall this app as the app crashed a lot of times i used it only once and then it abruptly stopped workingcould you please solve the issue
2,great app and concept but please in the next update please add an option to pause the timer also make it an option in settings not in deep focus mode because there are some thoughts that need to be addressed for a few minutes and if not addressed can ruin all the session it can also help in plant together because i have seen many people that gets an urgency but dont want to give up which breaks the loyality and ultimately breaks the purpose of planting together
2,the app keeps crashing
2,worked well for 7 days then it keep shutting i have pro version too
2,when installed the app works fine but after a few days it does not work at all the application just does not even open and i cant even save my forest it gets me demotivated to start again
2,great concept but unfortunately have to uninstall as its a data privacy risk our firewall detected and blocked hundreds of attempts to servers in china when the app was sitting open but idle for its function this app should be able to run locally without call outs unless theres an error state combine this with the permissions required and its too risky for my comfort hope to find a safer option elsewhere
2,there should have deep vibration mode after completion of 25 mininitial version had that settingi am unable to notice the completion of task as it vibrate for a moment onlyplz rectify itotherwise this is an excellent app
2,this is good but i cant use in my phone for more than a day its not opening in my samsung note10 lite please suggest a way to rectify this issue
2,the purpose of this app is great and is very affective till the time the app opens normally however every other day i have to reinstall this app as it stops working which is very annoying i might have to look for an alternate app there are serious bugs issues for android which needs fixing
2,i just update this app  now app not responding 
2,edit to reply you never used to need all these dodgy permissions what changed why do you need to read my notifications now update used to love this app now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do keep you from using your phone so so disappointing as now i have to let the app read all my notifications  or it becomes useless
2,crashing again
2,cant open this app
2,i have enough google play credits for pro version but while making payment a lower amount is shown whats the problem
2,app is not even opening wt is the point then
2,doesnt work anymore i can not go to the store to purchase different tree species anymore forest stops responding and im back on my home screen i cant have any sounds and the coins i earn disappear  i dont like it anymore its pointless but these glitches have actually made me more desciplined and i dont use my phone even without the fear of the plant dying the app sucks and i cant care more about reaching out to the developers 
2,the app is not opening please fix it it was running smooth before
2,its a good app its crashing on a daily basis
2,pro user ive been using this app for a long time and never had any problems with it but recently the app keeps crashing and even after reinstalling it works for a couple of minutes it crashes again the only way to actually use it is to use the forest extension on my laptop this is getting really frustrating and i actually liked the app can you please fix this issue because it seems a lot of other people seems to be experiencing this
2,the app is good but there are glitches after some time when the person tries to open the app it showed to clear the data of the app this deletes all the storage of the app the coins collected the forest made this leads to the disruption of the persons analysis of their focussed work hope youll soon rectify this error and hope the soon comes early
2,app kept on crashing i had to delete and download the app three times this week alone i love the app it has been very helpful but this issue has been very annoying
2,very nice 
2,it requires some pretty intense permissions in order to provide the best experience it may work for you but it didnt really work well for me
2,the apps good but after the update im having issues like the apps not recording the info after the completion of the timer it just crashes and starts from the beginning
2,this app is still not responsinh in my phone it keeps on closing i have upated it for like a thousand time
2,this app stops working everytime i install it i have already taken its subscription but now everytime i open it crashes i have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isnt solved
2,start crashing right after 2 daysbut the idea is good
2,it is very good but if i dont use it everyday than all my coins are gone and i have to replant it
2,this is a good app but the only problem is i cant use it properly because if i have planted a tree and come back to plant another one or to use any option in the app i cant do it it shows that unfortunately forest has stopped  there is no problem with my phone please repair this problem i liked the app but this problem is just annoying me
2,this app is wonderful but every time i click the store icon  the app stops suddenly if this issues is solved by developer ill definitely give 5 stars
2,the app was amazing but lately its been crashing a lot and i had to uninstall and reinstall it and yet it keeps in crashing i lost my data and its frustrating
2,everytime when i open this app it gets closed and says forest has unfortunately stopped and two stars for i think this is the best productive app for studying and focusing
2,from the beginning of downloading this app everything was perfectly fine i would have given it 5 stars about 2 weeks ago now i have given it 2 stars because as i try to open store and get new plants and trees the app crashes and closes so i am unable to get new plants please fix
2,after updating the app is crashing its not working
2,well i saw a lot of people using this app and base on theyre ratings they say its good but for me its not the app constantly crashes if i click some buttons inside the apps it always crashes whenever i try or need to use it please fix it i really want to use this 
2,not working great
2,please check fast this app is not working properly when i open the store for taking another tree then the app exit i reinstall but again it shows the same problem
2,the app is crashing while unlocking new trees i am not able to unlock new trees though i have enough coins with me
2,worst ap
2,it was working fine until i had to install it againonce i had installed it it woukd come on as normal but then when i went in settings to put my premium in since i bought that and then it just shut off abd said it wasnt responding no matter how much i tried even reinstalling itdidnt work
2,it is awesome appbut if it would contain the pause buttonit would be more meaningful as when one need to attend something in between the activityhe cant give up the tree moreover it leads to false analysis of focussed hours
2,i hate when the sounds ads come out out of nowhere eventho i close this app in the background
3,app was useful but i was very disappointed when a large number of trees were moved to premium without warning i had been saving up and watching extra ads for coins for weeks and then found there was nothing i wanted to spend those coins on it felt underhanded  i thought the deal was that i watch ads app gets revenue and i get a nice tree but then that deal changed if youre going to move features to premium it would be polite to warn users so they could spend saved coins first
3,this app really helps me focus i can study with a go
3,love the app and all the trees but 2 negative sides 1 the goal is to put aside the phone and so get a wonderful and lush full forest  so why is it that if a set a 120 min strike i got 4 trees but if a do 12 times a 10 min strikes i got 12 trees see the problem here to be less focus get me more reward not coherent 2 whats the crystal  really even after buying the pro version i should pay real money to have these trees not gonna happen and deceiving
3,no login option unless i repurchase pressing restore keeps telling me theres an issue with my google account but i cant fix it by doing what it says can now try to login using reset password because the popup closes when i go off the app to see the email then brings me back to entering my email so i cant enter the code also had to delete and redownload in the first place because allowed apps doesnt update as i download new apps
3,can we have some more tags i have a lot of subjects and i need to track how much time i spend for each it would be nice if we had the option to customise our color tags thank you
3,i really loved this app at first its super helpful and i love watching the little trees growʕ ꈍᴥꈍʔ bit when the new update came out almost all the time trees in the shop became available for premium users only  ive had this app for years now but when this shift happened i felt defeated all the coins ive saved up were pretty much useless after the update before i would have gave 5 stars but the new paywall really disappointed me and so many others
3,this app used to be very useful to help me stay focused on studying but now that im graduated and busier i dont always have control over how long ill be able to do a task for sometimes things come up and i cant stop my timer without ruining my tree it would be nice if i could set a stopwatch sometimes instead of a timer when i want to focus for as long as i can and cannot guarantee how long that will be
3,a helpful app helping me focused in such a cute way
3,i used to love it but now almost everything requires pro mode 
3,thats a good app for students
3,it works good
3,i buyed the pro version but after one day the features of the pro version are disabled and all i get its this message an error occurred 599 please try again later
3,very effective app but i cannot invite friends because of the up coming promotion
3,its useful but kinda sad that they have now made the cute trees a premium function 
3,first i rated 5 star but there is a bug  if a remove it from background it does not work anymore fix it
3,great app but i think i may have found a problem i dont know if this is phonespecific but the app stops working when i clear all apps the app seems to be working in the background but it doesnt forbid me from using other apps like its supposed to i request you to rectify this asap
3,hi i purchased the pro version of forest app on 221020 payment was successful and the amount of 180 got debited from my account but then some error in the app happened now the option of purchase is being shown again and i havent bee upgraded to the pro version yet kindly look into the matter and solve the issue  this is the payment confirmation message that i received thx for inb txn of rs180 frm ac x3312 to times of m refigajrcotv0 on 21oct20 if not donefwd this sms to 922
3,after you change it to pro version i have no motivation to study because i dont have tree iam a student and i cant buy pro version but i love your app very much before pro version please return it to free version
3,nice app but does not suites me
3,i absolutely love this app  would give it 5 stars if not for the glitch i keep encountering i purchased elixir to increase the number of coins i earn  also have the ad booster on my pro account if i use the ad booster with the elixir the ad booster doubles the number of coins earned based on the original number earned without the elixir as opposed to the number earned with the elixir this glitch makes it pointless to purchase the elixir as i would earn more coins with just the ad booster
3,i love this app and expect that i could have so many trees from the first day i install it but this app always become not responding in the next day and it happened every day so i must clear the data first and then use it again so all my tree gone 
3,great app but cant restore my premium purchase 
3,i really enjoy this app but when i try to log into my account on my tablet it only shows me to purchase it which i have already purchased on my phone i have already tried multiple times to log out of my other gmail accounts but to no avail
3,it is a great app but i can not log in with my account there is a 599 error what shoud i do
3,i used to love this app until the most recent update you have to unlock the pro version to buy most of the trees which is very disappointing i used to motivate myself by collecting money and buying an amazing tree but now you can only buy small plants with the free version
3,disappointed when you change all beautiful plants to be available only after upgarding to pro version it will only discourage people to download your app or even lose existing users suddenly its pointless for nonpro users to save coins the purpose of helping us focus would also be hindered
3,i just downloaded it i dont know what its experience
3,i think it helps you stay focused but the app needs work it has a lot of glitches emailed the devs even but none of there tips have helped
3,please add the widget because this app almost perfect
3,this is one of the apps that is way to confusion for me to use its nicely put together but its confusing and hard for us dumber people to understand it could use some work but its okay
3,its a great app but the fact that you have to pay for a full experience sucks
3,got e new phone cant log into my proaccount and cant restore purchase would have to buy it once again lost a lot of time with that instead of studying otherwise nice app like the idea and it is motivating
3,i just updated the app and i cant use it anymore cause it suddenly closesmy android version is 8where can i find the previous version to download im sooo sad
3,very good app for focused working the interface n graphic works are very good no alarm or sound notification for session time completion that can be easily incorporated in the app but missed
3,great app new update doesnt allow me to restore my pro status for some reason keeps saying i need to log out of other google accounts but i only have my one google account
3,i dont know who else has experienced this but since last 2 updates when i receive invitations to plant trees togheter i dont see anymore the type of the tree  and for how long they want to plant it togheter its always a 10 minute cedar so only after i accept the invitation i can see what tree they actually want to be planted
3,ive only tried it for a few days but so far its good
3,its above average
3,i hate the fact that not all the trees are of the free version not even a few new releases are in the free version please release a few trees for the free version also otherwise it is an amazing app
3,im quite dissapointed about the new update im a free user and i bought every tree using my coins but when i updated it all the trees i spend were gone or its only available in pro since i cant afford the pro im just dissapointed and sad that i cant unlock my trees unless im in pro ive been using this app and it was the best but now im rating it on 3 stars cause i cant unlock or use i spend in a year please help me get my trees back im sad right now 
3,i dont like the new actualization that the app have i cant buy any other tree unless i pay with real money i dont know what is the point to earn coins if you cant use them
3,its a good app and was very helpful however when the app updated it signed me put of my account and apparently i cant restore it would be helpful if you could fix this
3,love the app but i cant sync my devices any more for some reason
3,nice app to stay away from phone it will be more good if they provide free for like to plant a real tree so that more people can plant the real one especially for teenagers as they dont earn money
3,now that you have to upgrade to a paid version to earn most items theres a lot less motivation
3,its a shame you force to buy nice trees for real money it lowers the ambitious to use the app
3,i think more trees should be added which are not included in pro version
3,the app is giving good but if i delete recent tab of this i can easly access any apps which arent on white list without losing a tree you need solve that problem omg how the hell i got this idea now if i put on focus mode i use other apps by this trick plz update
3,worst app ever how can an app demand money for white listing i would suggest everyone to use yourhour app
3,a ideia é boa mas o fato de que tudo que você faz precisa passar por uma tela de loading agonia bastante
3,was nice but stopped working now i can leave the app and do whatever without the tree dying which defeats the purpose i changed all my settings and even deleted and redownloaded the app
3,happy
3,its all good and all but it doesnt help with productivity plus without premium a lot of the features cannot be used which is a sad thing for a broke student like me for me its overhyped
3,جميل جدا
3,i love this app but i have one problem the app doesnt allow me to sign up  shows error has occurred help me fix the problem please
3,this app is amazing
3,after the upgradation the plant is often become wither automatically why
3,theres no alarm whatsoever to notify me when the times over please help me out
3,how can i not have an alert alarm when i start to grow trees it beeps loudly regardless of the sound setting of my phone whether its muted or vibrating mode it beeps
3,updated review this was a 45 star app then they broke the app but have mostly fixed it now i preferred the original app functionality this version doesnt work for devices that dont allow certain permission it also doesnt work for anything that autoplays if i click on a youtube notification it will play and i can listen even though i cant interact and my vision is obscured by the overlay this does make the app less effective for me because my brain is a jerk and a dopamine fiend
3,app size is too big
3,great for focussing its a shame about the latest changes to the free version
3,love this app pro version is definitely worth it however my referral code would not pull up and i missed an oppurtunity to refer someone adding friends and creating a room together is way too difficult and i would also like to see the option to delete tags rather difficult to navigate app regarding all these things but i am hopeful to see what modifications are brought forward
3,i really love this app its calm and adorable in a way other focus apps arent but the paywall most of the trees have been put behind now just makes me sad if you care about planting fun trees be prepared to pay
3,thank you so much for the app i have a great difficulty on focusing to do stuff and this app helps me with it and even lets you choose the kind of cute plant you re going to plant thats what motivates me the most but now with the new update i can only chose what 6 types of plants you just took the most motivacional part of your app and i even spend the whole year to get a new one in my birthdaydo you guys think even about people who wont spend 50 on a fake tree congrats
3,very useful in my studies but i cant hear the time s up notif soundalarm whenever im done with my time i usually ended up doing my stuff overtime because i cant hear the sound that its already time to end also if i set time 1 hour continuously i can only plant 2 trees but if i set time only 10 mins i can plant around 45 trees per hour it doesnt make sense but overall thank u for this app
3,i paid for it and i like the features except the fact that after using a while in a cellphone when i installed the app in my new phone the tags havent had the same renamed names as ive done before  awesome way of focusing on activities with gamification
3,i really enjoyed the app before the update it was motivating to see different trees at one place after the update i cant buy the trees that i previously could
3,its alright it sucks that many things need to be bought otherwise its awesome
3,i really love this app and it motivates me to studyi was really excited to use the cute app  the pretty cute treesbut after i earned enough coins i found out that so many trees can only be bought if i had the premium versioni was also upset when i found out that only a couple of trees could be bought without premium a student without a credit card  my parents refusing to pay for iti was really bummed  upseti would have given five stars in the past when there was no premium version
3,i loooove this app but after the update half of the trees were only for premium members  i get you need a way to get money but really the only reason i was using the app was to get cool trees this made me kinda less motivated after the update 
3,nice app but free users have only limited features
3,اون قسمت با دوستان باز نمیشه
3,muito bom mas falta uns ajustes como sincronizar os contatos com o celular instagram ou facebook depois da última atualização ficou com um design muito bom outra coisa que seria bom na minha opinião séria um alarme ou algo semelhante quando terminasse o tempo estabelecido na plantação da árvore
3,loved this app just bought the pro version and im very disappointed with the watch add for double coins being removed you would imagine that being a pro member would get you the extra coins 
3,ramnya gede banget
3,i love this app and use it all the time however the selection of trees are now unfortunately limited due to a recent update  i was lucky enough to get some trees before the update however the way it was before used to motivate me to continue studying
3,how disappointing that most trees are now exclusive the version before the update suited most people as i can see 5 stars going 3
3,i really like this app it got me off of my phone in class time until my tree had grown i got sooo much work done
3,you best
3,it really helps me however you need to pay for a lot of things
3,its helpful but i need it my phone and my phone is ios and my parents wont let me pay
3,super app but mb kuduthalan
3,i loved this app a lot however after a recent update i got very little trees that i could buy i am not a pro version user and when i saved enough coins to buy a tree i updated the app before i bought the tree it was to my greatest disappointment that the tree i wanted to get was now the pro version and i could not buy it can you add more varieties of trees for the non pro version i feel that the previous version was better thank you
3,me pareció buena idea la app pero al entrar en la parte superior en plant mode que te da dos opciones no puedo seleccionar ninguna ayuda por favor
3,i really love this app it helps me so much to focus on my work and seeing how my forest looks after some hours of deep focus is really motivating despite that i unfortunately have been having some issues with the app i use the whitelist and ive noticed that when im planting my tree i can access not only the whitelisted apps but all of the apps in my device this is a real bummer and a hope you guys fix that please nevertheless is an awesome app and i cannot recommend it enough
3,used this on iphone it was amazing however it doesnt get the data from ios to android which is a problem
3,app molto comoda e semplice peccato che dopo lultimo aggiornamento gli acquisti possibili senza la versione pro sono diventati veramente pochi rendendo luso dellapp poco stimolante
3,when the timer ends we dont get any sound saying that the sound ended
3,the pear tree challenge is a major turn off
3,cool
3,very good 
3,ive recently purchased pro version in your forest app after i uninstalled it and reinstalled it i havent been able to restore the pro version again ive tried to log out of all but one google accounts as was suggested in the error message but nothing helps i was wondering if you could help me solve this issue thanks in advance
3,i am really loving this app but i have noticed that it doesnt send me a notification when my timer ends and it doesnt make any kind of sound which is kinda annoying i cant find anything for that problem in the options how can i fix this
3,it helps me too stay concentrated thank u for creating an app like this
3,i have problems with some buttons buttons that are in te top of the screen my smartphone doesnt detect them because its touching the area of the top bar but great app
3,ki
3,the app was great at first and still is a good resource for keeping focused and tracking study time however i purchased the premium version and have been unable to restore said purchase after resetting my phone the app is good but this is frustrating edit got in contact with support issue not solved likely going to repurchase pro since this app fits my needs best be cautious of resetting your phone or switching phones when deciding to go premium there is no solution it seems
3,en general la app esta muy bien pero depronto me dejo de funcionar y no importaba cuantas veces la instalara me aparecia lo mismo
3,no bad
3,this is so good app but after completing the time duretion of studying there is no alarm clock and every things are good actually excellent
3,hey forest team seen your progress grow over the years loving the new favorites and tags interface what would make it better is allowing multitag selections this is one pomodoro app that doesnt have breaks pls add a break timer after each sess would be nice under your new ui no trees would be selected or planted of course customized break times can also be added to favs thanks  lots of love
3,it was great but when my phone was reset and i installed again the app i cannot login even after purchasing the pro version it sucks having to purchase again
3,the notifications gave me really bad anxiety and i almost started crying but i think someone else could think it as useful to them
3,i have been liking it
3,used to be an amazing app but since the new update i cant buy any new plants 
3,그냥 재밌게 폰 안만질수있음
3,things you can do for free is becoming more and more limited most of the trees are exclusive for the paid version you cant use combination without the paid version most of the updates are only for the pro version and some features previously free now must be paid for the free version used to be good too but now get ready to spend some money the free app is a disguise the good things are now behind a pay wall not that its bad just a warning you have to pay for it
3,love the app hate the system purchased the pro version and loved it it is a very effective app and was working perfectly fine on my old phone i got a new phone and was hoping i would be able to sync my progress seamless through the cloud but the restore was unsuccessful contacted support and they told me my google play was defective and after troubleshooting i was still unable to sync my progress to the new phone was forced to purchase pro again in order to login and sync
3,my phone is not getting locked while using it i am able to use the other apps also
3,its really interesting
3,i like the overall idea behind the app but i think that its becoming more of a distraction than helping me stay focused 1 id prefer to set pomodoro sessions with breaks between them rather than having to do that manually everytime 2 also i dont understand why there is not an alarm after each study session and i have to check when the time is over 3 i dont like the way focus mode is designed id prefer to not receive notifications from the apps rather being unable to use them
3,sometimes it does not shows when break is overits only when i open forest it shows break is over
3,theres no more option for double coins after the last update how do i bring it back since the trees became so much expensive
3,used to be the best app for staying focusedbut bcoz of the new update maximum number of the species are are now only available for the pro version and the normal users are only left with the species costing 300 which are only 8 plus three free ones and im also facing a lot of crashes i have to reinstall it but the same thing happens after a few monthspls fix this problem
3,all the trees open only after taking premium 
3,i love this app the only thing i would change is the idea of logging in with premium i got a new phone and cant go back to the moment where i had so many trees planted all my trees are gone 
3,very nice app helps me keep focused
3,free and great
3,hey this app is so very usefullbut the only thing it is lack of a music after the completion of each slots
3,idk if its my phone or this app but i cant get it to work properly ever since i got a new phone the allow apps feature should only allow a few apps to be used but when thats turned on i can access all apps regardless of the list making it pretty useless i allowed everything for this app in my phones settings but still no change disappointing since i used to love this app
3,no i dont want to try sleeptown yes im sure i dont want to try sleeptown town yes im absolutely sure i dont want to try sleeptown please stop asking that often thanks
3,i love this app but since the last update i cant open the store to unlock new trees for the love of mother earth please fix this i need more cute trees aaa
3,not able to restore purchase keep saying i need to log out other account but i only had the exact account on my device i contacted dev they said could be my google play store problem but i also tested on other devices cant restore and contacted google which google says is the app sides problem still waiting to fix this i purchased the pro version just few days ago
3,i dont like the new update
3,limited amount of motivation amd support  id personally prefer for it to have a pomodoro timer too
3,all is great but i dont get notifications when time out how i can fix it
3,it was a great app i loved use it while i studied and in return i got to earn coins to get new plants now most of the plants are pro only and i hate it
3,helped to focus very useful app but what now every time i update the app it stops working and i have to uninstall the app and reinstall so that i lose the progress i made till then very sad but the heart breaking part is that almost all the lovely plants became available only in the pro version many of them already unlocked before
3,it really helped me to get out of my addictions and live a days to its fullest but ads are the main  problem
3,i recently unlocked the pro version but i have experienced a lot of difficulties 1 there is no sound notification even i followed all steps 2 i added the plant reminder but still there was no notification i hope you find solutions for these things i really love this app yet due to the troubles that is why i gave 3 stars waiting for the new update and i will change my rating if the problems are resolved
3,after completion of planting time it doesnt plays sounds notification and because of this time exceeds in one task more than one and causes mismanagement kindly fix it
3,it doesnt let you take a break when you finish your study sessions i love the app and ive been using it for a long time but the last weeks it doesnt work correctly ill come back to it when the issue is fixed
3,if only i still had access to my old trees not needing to purchase the pro version i would be so grateful nevertheless great app
3,used to love it but all the trees are now paid versiononly that really sucks i barely have the motivation to collect more points might just uninstall
3,cant buy the pro version i love this app tho
3,im giving this app 3 stars right off the bat because of ad walls but heres why i understand that app developers need to make money somehow but there are multiple ways to do it and this is not the right choice for an app about productivity productivity is about managing your time when your developer makes you sit and watch an ad its a waste it is immediately sending the message that they do not care about your time and therefore they dont care about your productivity just your money
4,fun challenging frustrating at times without premium
4,i have one question how to use sunshine
4,this app has been helpful to me in focusing i wish it has a break mode nevertheless i am happy with the app and i look forward to my forest
4,please add more trees baobab is amazing great incentive for funny trees
4,is a great app to focus on doing your homework or the work you need to do
4,i really like it but there are some things that i need to pay for them
4,i like this app so far it seems cool
4,the app is very good but i want to add a ring when the time finished it will be an excellent app when this future in it
4,really cute app and i love it but i wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer take a short break then resume studying itll be really nice edit still nice but its boring now not gonna lie and i find it so unfair that we have to pay again for a more exquisite tree when we already did my motivation just drops
4,i cant pay for the premium version
4,having less screen time now but i hope that instead of just having virtual trees real trees were planted everytime we have reach a certain time for not opening our phones 
4,really cute way to help you tackle the negative effects of smartphones on your attention span still testing
4,app is good working but i cant get notifications when time is over i hope to thats just a little problem
4,they asked me to rate them
4,aplicativo top abraços
4,is a greap app to stop looking at the phone every 5 sec and getting distracted
4,i hope this gives more opportunities for people without pro version as mostly students are using and we cant really afford to payoverall i love this apps and helps me so much 
4,this has been really helpful for me to be more productive i wish that there were one or two more trees available at the start as this would motivate me more to make my forest look different and id spend more time earning more coins its a slight incentive but it would work for me i like the fact that i get the redirect message if i happen to tap on an app that i shouldnt be using
4,the app is good but uninstalling coz almost many things are premium that irritates me
4,постоянно чтото всплывает и деревьев мало
4,i absolutely love this i love using the deep focus mode often  it keeps me from getting distracted i love the concept of growing your own forestit feels like a game  thats really lovely i like all the asmrs they put me in a study mode and is really useful edit removing a star bc i dislike the new update edit2 after reading the replies ive understood still feel like its a dirty move at least make new trees available for us for a day or smth  then lock it for premium
4,i like the app i can manage my time more but im confused why its not ringing when the work is done
4,nice app to keep focused but the premium its ok but the app soo good
4,overall nice app but it shows a update notification every time i open the app which sucks but apart from that very nice app for measuring productivity
4,best but paid
4,i love it but would it be possible to have a pause button in case the user diverts herself from the task by reason of bathroom breaks or any other just cause i love it though thank you
4,nice app  for students
4,not yet used this time lets see if i can avoid making the exception list to long
4,referal system is a little wonky but its great for studying
4,awesome app to focus in study
4,help you to foucs and also activate the reward system in your brain
4,an alarm would be a perfect addition
4,very nice nice but
4,hi forest team i do love your apps so much and it is able to help me focus on study i just bought the premium version fews day ago however currently i am facing problem in sync the old phone forest data into the new phone the new phone showed need to pay only can log in can your team assist me on it 
4,great app fun to use would have given it 5 stars if you could take 5 min break on the same plant then continue growing it i like working with the pomodoro method
4,интересное приложение
4,hi  wonderful app works great  does its job well  its simple and easy to use  on recommendation please add timetables to keep track and set how we want to spend our time  otherwise  superb 
4,i have premium but thought it would be better if there are more trees available since players are able to build their own biome eg desert that would add more fun to the app
4,the app is great but how do i get my account with pro version back it says there is some kind of an error and i need to log out of all the accounts except for the one i bought the pro version with i did so and it didnt work
4,the problem with this is that when my phone screen is off it doesnt give a notification that the tree is planted even though do not disturb is off and silent mode is off and the notification are on please fix this
4,good for studying and doing revision
4,the features were great thats why i upgraded to premium immediately however whenever my time is upthe app does not notify hopefully my concern will be solved
4,this is a very nice app but some free features are kind of limited to use until you get the premium features but i still use it though
4,is it a chinese or taiwanese official app  ans me
4,i love the app but i personally would love it if i could plant trees with the coins i made since i have forest i am a lot more concentrated
4,love the app it kinda sucks that they moved so much stuff from the free version the the premium version but the premium isnt really expensive so its ok the only thing im sad about is that the new trees that have been added recently dont change over time whether you plant it for half an hour or two hours itll end up looking the same and that sucks cuz letting my tree be more beautiful if i plant one for longer is a motivation factor for me so id like to see that change 
4,great app i wish plants and sounds were cheaper basically you get coins for planting trees and you can use them to buy other types of trees and different background sounds
4,i really love this app it helps me focus i recommend it
4,honestly this is super helpful little sad half of the tree choices are only available if paid for but the rest of it works really well
4,useful aesthetically pleasing and great motive to be productive plantatree
4,love the app the paid version is 100 worth it the only thing missing is nested tags id like to be able to tag a tree as study  econ 101 for example
4,this app is so good but premium is very is not very good as before it was released lots of the now premium trees where not originally paid for so i think that there should be no premium
4,its a very useful app for the people who wants to concentrate for a big amount of time without checking their phones im a student and i use this app every time that i do my assignments for the day because it helps me to stay focused on what im doing
4,good app to focus
4,i wanna get allow list but cant buy pro version in our country
4,i love this app and use it religiously while studying it is a life saver i use the app along side the desktop chrome extension and i tend to start both timers at the same time this messes with my stats and the length of time i have stayed focus is doubled i wish there was a way you could chose to limit multiple devices at one time now i dont know how feasible it is but it would be really helpful and really add to the experience of using the app
4,so good
4,i like trees
4,i think this app is very useful because when i didnt have this app my little brother cant finish his homework on time but when i setted 30 minutes for the forest my little brother already finished five homework in 30 minutes
4,it is actually really nice and good at keeping me productive its a shame we miss out on so many features by not having premium
4,amazing tool for studying
4,very cute and helpful app i just wish we had more plants haha
4,it needs a lot of buying which disallows us to use basic features majority of users are students so it isnt convenient for them to spend money on it
4,its a great app to focus and check progress
4,its a goof app but it wont let me tern on deep focus mode pleas fix it and ill give a five star
4,good app helps me focus on the things that i need to do first too bad you have to pay for it but its unleashing my green thumb 
4,its a good app it does help me focus but not all the time i still get distracted but that is mostly my fault however i wish that forest would notify me while staying on focus to make sure im still doing it
4,nice app and very helpful
4,very good app i enjoyed using it i hope ut has more expanded time and theme
4,this app really made me look forward to studying and is helpful cause it gives you breaks as well as different options instead of studying like sleep meditation and a lot more
4,help to stop getting distracted by phone
4,wow a nice app east to use and i get a lot of fun
4,very interesting to keep people focus and see the amount of progress they are making in there life
4,most trees are premium now sigh
4,good app liked it helps to remain focused
4,please add a stopwatch timer that is my only wish
4,helped me to be productive
4,this little app has been great at keeping me focused while at work set a time goal and pick the plant you want to add to your forest and then get to work or study 
4,its hard to pay in china mainland
4,good positive reward n feedback system based app for focused stay
4,เปนแอปทดเหมาะกบการฝกใหตงเองโฟกสกบการอานการเรยนการทำงานไดดเลยคะ แตขอเสยคอถาอยากมแอคเคาท จะตองเสยเงนเทานนอะ ซงมนแยมาก เราแคอยากมแอคเคาท ไวเกบตนไมของเราเฉยๆ ถาอยากไดออปชนอะไรเพมเรากคงจะซอทหลงมยอะ ทำไมตองใหเสยเงนสมครเปนพรเมยมถงจะมแอคเคาท
4,i was liking it a lotbut when the new update camei am unable to choose any type of tree and i dont like that plz fix the bug
4,this app is good thank you
4,many stupid annoying bugs
4,for whatever stupid reason it works and its adorable while its at it dont let your trees die i want the ability to add multiple tags to a tree though sometimes i want that 2hr tree but will be doing more than one type of task
4,the app is great but there some glitches and ways to access other apps also there should be an option for creating a list of apps that you want open during the session like calculator or any other useful or the other person wants to use
4,very effective app i love it 
4,great wish youd release more trees though more often love the artwork
4,its okay but all of the cool are for the pro version i am not going to pay to studybut its ok
4,very nice and calming
4,helps me with paying attention to my work
4,it only give me 10 mins option thats it
4,i love the app it really helps me focus on my work and organize the recorded hours for study work rest etc i only wish that they put a break time when we study because if i pause it either kills my plant or i have to restart planting again i always study 2 hours but i like to take breaks each hour also the plants you get are very limited i had this app for 2 years and they used to not charge you  not coins to plant cool plants but now they do other than that its a great app
4,has really helped me stayed motivated and focused on the task at hand i can set specific tasks to what im doing and timers to go along with them then to make it fun i can change the type of thing im growing really good for youth all the way to professionals
4,great app very helpful and really cute interface i just want it to go with deep focus mode without asking for so much of permissions otherwise its really great app
4,i wish i could do 45 stars because the only thing i dont like is that most of the trees sounds etc are only for premium users i read your replies to others and i respect the reasons but it is a little annoying
4,i write this after the first use and yes i will be using this for studying cleaning and what ever else i need to focus on i love the art and simplicity of this app the unlock of different trees makes this into a little game as a side bonus if i try to roam into different apps on my phone it will tell me to get back to business they took away the unlock trees paying for the nice looking trees is something i wont do not happening but the app still works well and does as stated above
4,good and very focused app to make up everything
4,i love this app so much it really helps a lot whenever i study but i hope you could give more features for free  its a great app
4,45  it deserves a 5 since it really helps with staying focus for a period of time yet i would suggest to somehow overlay a social place in order to focus together with friends and that if you paid for the appwhich i did gladly get more currency ingame kinda sucks to pay for premium and still need to grind for new trees at least open a few more for premium users so they would be more motivated to unlock more trees
4,it has been fixed thanks 3
4,this is very good app but i have to get premium get access to work essential apps overall very good
4,the app keeps on crashing everyday i open it  even after i got a pro account  this feels really irritating  edit15102020 the problem was successfully resolved by the team  and apart from that  the app runs smooth  and is highly helpful and fun 
4,overall experience with this app is good its cute works great
4,i love it 
4,need alarm
4,a handy task timer
4,this app is great all in all it helps me focus and reminds me to have breaks which i usually forget its sort of a mini study assistant on the down side if you dont have the proversion you miss out on alot of things for example you cant actually plant real trees without the pro which was the main reason i choose this app im not a fan of buying things in apps like these so i was pretty bummed
4,helps me focus when i study sometimes i just like to look at my phone some video of some sort and study but forest allows me to hear nature sounds and help me focus
4,you will waste your time anyways its just this app will keep you aware how much your phone using hinders your productivity
4,this app has helped me a lot
4,it helps but you have to focus yourself tho
4,nice all
4,this is a very nice app i loved it but i am not able to open other spieces of trees it says upgrade to pro versioninstead you can show some ads instead of paying for itif this issue is cleared  ill change the rating to 5 its a requestplease look in to it
4,nice  one
4,its okay i unlocked a tree it took my coins but when i went to plant the tree it said i needed to unlock it all my coins were still gone
4,it is a very good app
4,there are still several bug even i get pro
4,the app is great but since i use it primarily on my tablet having landscape mode will be very appreciated hope this feature will be added in the near future
4,awesome app helps keep me focused the friends feature keeps me accountable and it lets you track your time to really measure your productivity only flaw is that we cant use phone and computer at the same time without duplicating results i get distracted by both computer and phone apps i also think we should be able to see the trends of our sessions on the pc the tree store should also be accessible on pc otherwise highly recommend
4,really enjoy using this app the only problem for me is that it doesnt tell you when the time ends so i continue doing what im doing until i realize its time to stop
4,good app for focus
4,useful app help in increase productivity
4,add public rooms where we can catch up with people preparing fr same exam
4,great app makes study more fun
4,its a wonderful app  this app keeps me away from phone and makes me study well i planted one tree and next i was curious to grow trees and make big forest overall i was happy with this app
4,helped a lot
4,free version lacks any motivation to actually get off your phone since the tree grows no matter what app youre on
4,nyc
4,helps with focus but menus are not intuitive
4,okay so ive actually had this app for a good eternity however i never used it because im rarely productive since ive been more busy and i need to focus my time on certain aspects im starting to use this app more and more the only reason why its not five stars is because i want more sounds otherwise its perfect
4,this app is so amazing before i was not doing study but when i downloaded this app i started studying it is very helpfull for me i would request that you should make more apps like the forest app
4,it is a good app
4,gd app
4,very good graphics
4,i love this app is so cute and also help me but some i have to pay
4,absolutely love the app the graphics are marvelous however the only tweak that should be made in my opinion is for the timer to be atleast 3 hours longeri understand people could take advantage of that because some could do it while sleeping but with the pandemic 5 hours would be nice maybe 7 for people doing school the phone for me has been extremely distracting for me  this app helps me heavily but when the timer is only 2 hours max i inevitably take advantage of this distraction
4,nice appdo check out all the best
4,this app is very good the only problem i was on deep focus mode with the music turned on i was cleaning all thr apps to not get distracted and accidentally deleted forest now the music wont stop the timer has already finished and i cant use my phone there is a rainforest song on the phone i would like some help
4,in statistics i cannot see how many hours i have spent on each tag which is really frustrating it only shows percentage it will be really helpful if you add that feature in future
4,great  error 600 trying to invite friends tho
4,i really love this app and my friends and i have created a remote study group using it one suggestion i have is i wish my friends could join into my group study session at any time after theyve been invited and just plant a tree for how long the rest of the session lasts if i am using deep focus i cant communicate with my group about setting up another study session and at what time itd be nice if they could just join for the remaining time
4,4 estrelas porque o app é ótimo para ajudar a manter o foco e tem uma iniciativa positiva com relação ao plantio de árvores porém eu tava juntando moedinha pra comprar a love tree e logo quando eu consegui ela virou exclusiva 
4,love the idea of this app
4,amazing app
4,there are stuff to buy with true money like more plants  backround sonds etc it should have been better if these things were free
4,time limit is maximum 180 min ki b honi chahye
4,good app butif we want to plant tree
4,good to use
4,the app is great
4,i love this app it provides me a method to avoid distraction but ever since they locked most of the plants with a paywall i dont know about that now i cant buy the plants that i want without payingbut i understand they had to do this at some point 
4,n tive paciência então desinstalei mas é um game legal
4,loving the app
4,deleted old tags show up again when installing app on another device also my timer doesnt start automatically in plant together mode and i can quit even when room owner started the timer it takes 1020s to sync the countdown timer
4,it s a nice app keeps you focused but i have a suggestion it would be nice to make the forest ground different like with snow with rain etc and as well it would be cool to be able to rearrange the trees how you like them to be please try making this happen 
4,great productivity app
4,original
4,i had pro version already so i didnt lose access with the update but its a crappy move to lock everything behind a paywall they still make money off most of us because the ads after every tree for doubling coins i make a lot of small trees too because its easy small goals make for l u s h forests the time crystal currency that lets users get missed event trees for a couple dollars is a good idea though they can make their money and people who had a hiatus or started late arent left out
4,if i purchase pro version on my one phone and after a month i changed my mobile so after that can i use my previous pro version in new mobile
4,هايل بصح خصرتوها كي درتو التسجيل بالدراهم
4,the limited no of trees in the new update upsets me 
4,liked it but would have been better if it had more of a game like feel i mean if we did not use for like 40 min may be there could be a bird if we did not use it for another 40 min may be she could lay an egg in another 40 min that egg may hatch like that its just an example
4,its a very productive appp i really love it tqu
4,this ap is very important app for student and topper student thanks
4,good for keeping track of your time
4,good in maintaining my study focus
4,great visual to keep you motivated
4,best productivity app my only suggestion would be to allow syncing between ios and android once youve purchased it on either platform
4,amazing concept students must download this app if they are doing self study
4,we can easily close the recent apps and can use another applications in the deep focus modeplease fix this issue
4,i feel bad if u were to leave the plant die so this does help me focus so i could keep it alive
4,i dont always use it when im studying bc i dont always need it but if im having a hard time starting tasks or keeping track of the time its a great thing to kickstart getting some work done i love looking at the little plants when im done
4,it motivate us
4,im a premium user and ill be very glad if you can persuade me to spend more time with the app

5,this app does exactly what it says it has beautiful plants such as star coral and flowered bushes the sounds are very relaxing and i like that you can set the time and reason you want to focus overall very good app
5,i really like the app and its very very helpful for me especially the plant together feature its the only app i have purchased the premium version so far the only thing i would like to have and i dont is to be able to change the forests floor sometimes the green doesnt match the theme of my forest but thats really me being nitpicky great app

5,this helps me get so much done i would definately recommend getting this app
5,i enjoy using this app however the only concern i have is when i grow trees with friends i am unable to see the duration of time it would be lovely to be able to see it also a suggestion perhaps add a new feature where we can customise our own tree and have it named that would be so cute haha

1,does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me do not recommend waste of time
1,worst app requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with email whats the use of signing up with email if you cannot sync the data its just a calender without premium membership better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application ive lost all my progress that ive been tracking from 300 days shittiest app ever
1,can only track 5 habits at a time
1,really liked the app and have been using premium but now i want to transfer to a new device i can only doing this by signing up but whenever i go to the sign up section and type my email and password nothing happens and it asks me to sign up again really frustrating if you guys can solve this it will definitely be 5 stars
1,limited free goals
1,this app seemed to have all the features i wanted but the sync did not work after i paid 10 for the sync feature i emailed their support with no reply very bad customer service

1,guess i cant use this app after paying for premium 
1,update 2020 sadly they didnt reach out to me despite me paying for premium version lost my account and no means of logging back in otherwise the app is good especially the ui like this app but until recently i had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so its all confusing if you could help me locate my account as i bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account please help because i want to use this great app
1,app was good in past but not anymore it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since as per details in app page last update was on 28th jun 2018 but still it is the first thing that comes in results when i search for habit  i guess google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years
1,used to be good now support is gone and cant sync devices anymore pity
1,the app itself is great i used it quite regularly a few years back but when i tried to use it again it seems that the new owners dont acknowledge their lifetime subscription sure hope my emails get more results besides  ignore kthnxbye sent an email  they said they opened a ticket and then  crickets nice  thanks downgraded to
1,not updated anymore unstable
1,dont buy the premium version of this app synching doesnt work stick with the free version which would be 4 stars

1,spamming me to rate well here you go
1,update dropped 5 star rating to 1star app will not sync i have it on android and ipadand neither one of them will sync to the server app store shows 8 months since any updates would not have paid for premium if i knew it wasnt going to be maintained original review i wanted to make something like this myself but theyve already done a great job i feel more obligated to the daily habits im trying to build and its great that it tracks my completion streaks
1,app crashes
1,this app lost all my data i would sync every day but when i had to reinstall and tried to syncnothing i had paid the money for premium but now it wants me to pay again
1,the idea behind the app is good although after paying for premium the promised cloud sync does not work several users mention the same issue there is no way of backup the data either i cannot see any feedback from devs here switched to a different app habits
1,if its a passion project id be willing to support the creator but this seems to now be held by just a shell holding
1,premium does not work false advertising
1,find a new app overall if you havent noticed the devs left this app as of recently the servers are dead this means you cant make an account forums are gone motivation pictures gone etc find a new app
1,how do i get a refund
1,i was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features but they took the money and provided nothing at all i tries contacting the developer via email and no answer at all stay away
1,i have been using the app from the last 3 years i am a premium user when trying to sign in a new device and sync its not syncing i need my data please help with this issue even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding so i am changing the rating from 3 to 1
1,vorrei avere indietro i miei soldi visto che il login non funziona e che non sembra esistere unassistenza tecnica i want my money back since i cannot login
1,dont install this appthis is forgery ive used this app for more than 2 years when i changed my mobile phone i couldnt login when i logged in it says this email account is not in our database i have the mail to prove that i had had the account in the appi mailed the company 45 times but theres no reply 2 years of my habit data is lost
1,decent but premium features like sync do not work cant even reimport data you exported yourself had i realized this i would have never have bought the app its just false advertising i now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it wont be inevitably lost
1,do not pay for the app sync doesnt work  they dont support the app but they are always ready to take your money
1,after installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls after removing the app from my phone i received fewer spam calls it might be a coincidence but it might not be
1,update 110220 use at your own risk as expected no contact from developers app has not been updated since 2018 this app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone a dereinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers very upset and disappointed
1,the app itself gets the job done but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions dont waste your money with premium you wont get what you pay for
1,i paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality which fully does not work ive tried reinstalling the app reinstalling android getting a new phone no luck emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply if i want to take a backup i have to screenshot everything not ideal apart from this the app is decent its got a cute meme
1,stealing in 2020 make an app call it habitbull make people buy it remove it from playstore republish the same app with a different name
1,paid for premium sync does not work publisher does not reply started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem going to try to get my money back nice app if you dont care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support switched to goalify and finding them extremely responsive
1,updating my previous review i recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits yet the app only shows me of having 30 days this is the same bug i reported last year it appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the new year ive reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone im giving up on this app and suggest you do too ive used this for a couple of years there was a bug where one week of my tracking wasnt recognized by the app this happened the week of new years i reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back unfortunately this has become an unreliable app for tracking
1,this app doesnt sync data
1,the widget and sync functions does not work on premium i get the widget error telling me to log in but i already have and even reinstalled the app nothing works developer please fix this
1,no further improvement ui is kinda suck there are many better alternatives
1,this was a great app but it hasnt been updated since 2018 and sadly it be can become unusable in an instant with no fixes in sight i cannot recommend this app i would try something similar maybe open sources or with dev support
1,paid for premium so i could sync between devices but it doesnt work and customer service will not respond to my inquiries
1,paid premium it doesnt sync at all costumer service unresponsive for a long time dont spend money on premium this app is dead the last update was in 2018
1,good app but no updates even after sending few suggestions what is the point in buying paid version
1,sync not working dont buy inapp purchase
1,paid for premium does not sync
1,failed to connect to facebook
1,facebook login fails with an error from facebook saying the login method hasnt bee implemented correctly
1,lost all my data when i moved to ios
1,hyper masculine tone is very offputting and irritating hint to developers women try to change habits too at least give us the option of just having hints in our own words
1,paid for the premium app last year now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when i first paid for it lots of complaints on here get one of the open source habit trackers  back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly  try to charge again seen this happen so many times
1,does not sync across my devices which it claimed it does only reason i purchased looking for my refund
1,its working anymore after paying for premium
1,does not log in after 5 minites its still trying to log itself in
1,had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting now using a different app this pathetic app that i paid premium for would not sync check internet connection every damn time i paid for the damn app sadly probably past my refund day
1,unsupported doesnt contain sync feature wouldnt issue refund to the makers and google get on your hands and knees and repent to gd
1,why are you counting inactive habits for the 5 habits total its ridiculous there are many other apps that dont have this silly cash grabbing limit
1,online sync is no longer working and last update was june 2018 which is more than a year is there a reason why i should continue using this app
1,absolutely do not upgrade to premium it does not work it does not sync the developer does not respond google play will not give a refund the frees app is flexible you can track yesno and count per day habits the count per day can be any criterion you want minutes calories quantity
1,high background usage sorry cant waste my battery spyware like this
1,very bad premium services developers are not taking care of this app anymore
1,please add reminder  or show me how to sett
1,lies no multidevice syncing on premium
1,abandoned by the devs  hasnt been updated in over a year sync doesnt work at all which was its main advantage over rival apps dont waste your time
1,premium subscription for such a simple app is greedy
1,expensive old and without any support also much better alternatives are available now
1,i like the app but i dont like rating apps and this one constantly nags you to do so with no option for it to stop even with the paid version so 1 star for being annoying after ive given them my money
1,files lost forver no updates and broken
1,awsome application i purched it but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock  plz add this type of features the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen from last 10 month its not getting synchronising plz do something developer we paid for it
1,very expensive for a simple app and quite useless without buying the premium only tracks 5 habits lame i cant believe this is the app advertised in the play store and still has a high rating because it is garbage sounds like even if i bought premium it would be worthless for transferring data to a new phone as the app claims i wont even risk it
1,broken so far not impressed i bought this expecting multidevice sync and havent seen it do that it wouldnt even restore a backed up file after logging off then on
1,developer is nonresponsive for some reason when downloading the app from the play store it associates with the incorrect google account i have verified i am downloading the app with my intended account however it continually associates with the wrong account its not really a big deal but i was planning to upgrade to premium with my play store credits the account this app associates to does not have any
1,app hasnt synced in 190 days wont let me log out still loads all my old data from last sync hasnt been updated since 2018 that should be the best clue dont buy
1,i loved this app ive been using it for years today i have updated it and mh2 premium account just vanished now it prompts me to buy premium again what happened could you help me please after a few years and after the second time paying for a premium membership and after no one reacted to my complaint my premium membership and all my data vanished again without any backup as promised this happens everytime i buy a new phone very dissapointing i will not fur sure buy a third premium
1,no longer syncs no longer supported so no longer installed on my phone was a good app shame 
1,cant sign up with email
1,will not let me register tried uninstalling and reinstalling tried both the email login and the facebook login
1,need more habit columns for free
1,no longer syncs
1,the last update was more than a year ago and things started to stop working the company that owns it seems to be a scam it was a great app i paid for it and got no support
1,sync not working anymore
1,if you pay for premium you wont actually get the premium services as other reviewers have noted troubleshooting steps from their site dont work and no one responds to the support email contact google and theyll reject your refund request
1,app no longer supported data loss likely was a great app until i needed to migrate to a new phone the sync feature never worked and i lost months of habit data i tried contacting the developer via the supplied email but zero response i used to recommend this app to many people but im done with it
1,i have paid for the premium features but the sync is not working i mailed them but got no response
1,the app hasnt synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user the support team havent acknowledged my email its a good concept but theyve failed to make it work and dont provide customer support check other reviews go to playgooglestore on a web browser select my account and go to order history select the  and it offers you an option to request a refund that should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling
1,only 5 habit you can update
1,very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber strongly recommend against this app not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails
1,sync isnt working no response to emails no updates for ages
1,its been 1 week since im using the app the reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning really disappointed may be uninstalling the app after few days hope this helps
1,i bought premium and now i cant login to the app using facebook and i cant login any other way i get this message login failed you cant use facebook to log into this app or website because theres an issue with its implementation of facebook login
1,gives a cheap buy once option for android users but for apple users a more expensive yearly subscription price which is very discriminatory
1,an app absolutely focused on my needs that has broken the sync function broke down about 3 or 4 months ago it can export its data to csv but not import it
1,sync doesnt work paid for premium had to get a new phone and it wont transfer as other reviews say it seems this app has been abandoned unfortunate because i liked it
1,like another commenter said just installed it on new phone and even though signed in it doesnt give my my paid for premium previous phone checked the sync and last sync was 128 days ago
1,purchased the premium the app stops sending notifications after some days i have to repeatedly open the app to get notifications waste of money
1,sync does not work ive tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine had to switch phones when my old phone died and cant get my old data back on the app because sync doesnt work also no way to import data great app if the feature worked or could import data but rendered useless because of this so if i switch phones or have to reset to factory standards i lose everything paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone but it does not work
1,sync doesnt work
1,dont buy the primium subscription the app does not sync as it says also support never answer
1,do not buy premium devs are not responsive and there is no way to reach them should you have any issues contacted them several times to transfer purchase to new phone nobody responded10 wasted
1,takes ages to load each time i open it up used to be good time to say goodbye
1,pathetic i was totally in love with this app until i changed my phone i lost the phone and when i installed the app in my new phone everything was gone my habits data for last one year every damn thing and i have purchased premium of the highest cost theres no way to restore my data or contact the devs if you cannot save on json file of mine in your cloud please explain why i should buy premium there is a sync option in the app dont tell me i should have manually synced my stuff
1,do not use this app for tracking your habit for long time youll lose your data if you do t pay the premium membership ive lost 3 months of daily tracking data of my habits
1,purchased by premium getting error can not sync emailed support no response dont waste your time or money
1,do not purchase the app works as its supposed to with exception for the added purchase features i bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices that feature does not work despite following the faq as to why it might not work i have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund
1,cant log in with facebook
1,the reminders dont work no noise no vibration i even bought premium to see if that would help no luck if i wanted a place to just mark my progress id keep an excel spreadsheet
1,i bought the premium version of this app and it doesnt work the reminder does not function which basically renders the app useless i emailed the support team and i havent gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt i want a refund what a waste of my money
1,needs to allow more habits in the free version giving people time to use the app and consider upgrading
1,reminder did not appear
1,unnecessary limiting of number of habits to be tracked use habit loop app instead
1,app is not supported anymore and syncing not working
1,reminder does not work
1,appears to be an abandoned app
1,update october 2019 very dissapointing the syn function is no longer working which i found out while rying to transfer my history to a new phone some other reviews have noted that too the export option also seems iffy at least when i tried to email the export nothing happend and i found no import since i paid for the app i would expect these to be available will change stars if resolved its dissapointing because this is one of the best habit tracking app but the lack of sync and exportinport function is a deal breaker update march 2015 what happened to the option to switch between the weekly and monthly view it was very useful i tried a number of other apps for habit tracking and this one is the best so far very clean and easy to navigate interface useful statistics and clear feedback on both the streak and the overall trend and percentage i love the easy way to switch between weekly and monthly view one suggestion would be to include a colored bar for each habit where the colors are based on the daily success and failures i saw this in one of the better iphone habit apps i actually used habit streak pro for years and i did see habitbul earlier but the bull icon deterred me from trying it because i thought it looked really cheesy the app behind this cheesy icon is actually the best of the habit trackers i have tried so far keep up the good job
1,synchronisation is not working its dishonest to sell a service that doesnt exist 
1,its not working properly always fails to remind no more reminder notification this feature suppose to work for free version if the promise features in free version doesnt work how can i get confident to buy paid version  request team to fix this issue
1,20191024  revised from 5 to 1 star app is dead all my data gone never again trust an app you cannot export and organize your data and to a universal format avoid as others said recently
2,no quotes
2,widgets dont work unless you open the app and sometimes you then you even have to take an action or two within the app wish this product was maintained have emailed the developer but they didnt get back to me the app doesnt even support logging out anymore the usual uninstallreinstall didnt work
2,i really like the app but i wish that i could slowly increase my goals without losing my streak
2,the user interface is not user friendly no one likes to use a complicated app to build habits which will make their work even more harder make it simple and easy to understand man
2,it is difficult to understand
2,the widgets do not work please add auto back and provide some analyticsgraphs on the habits management and formation
2,like many premium users i received an automated email letting me know that following a bug my password was reset after that impossible to use the premium features any more developer doesnt respond such a shame
2,i really like the app ive even purchased the ad free version to support the developer however be advised  if you use the app and need to change your phone or reset it your data will be lost and you will not have any support after i factory reset my phone i dont have any of my previous habit data even though its supposedly synced with my google account thats over 2 years of info that i lost ive sent multiple emails to the developer and have not received any response since
2,it seems like a good app but only offers 5 habits to track on the free version ill stick with it for now and see if it is helpful over the 66 recommended days but might uninstall if i feel the need to monitor further habits
2,yo fix the widget
2,reminders are not on time
2,like others have said in here the widget freezes and then you have to delete it and readd it to work again even a phone reset wont get it going
2,wont allow me to register or make an account tried to set up without on to try it out but as soon as you lose the app the habits you have set up disappear not the best trial
2,this app has not been functioning this week it has not been reminding me on any of my habits super frustrating i loved this tracker and now i may have to look into another  ive tried deleting reseting uninstalled and reinstalled nothing but if you remember on your own you can put it in and itll keep track
2,reminders aint working
2,a little too complicated and dictatorial too many prompts plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version 710 habits and i may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run instead i decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs
2,free account limited to 5 habits
2,reminders only pop up when i remember to open the app which defeats the whole purpose if the reminders popped up automatically at the set times id give the app 5 stars
2,complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest atleast widget should be available for trials
2,advertises that you own your data and you can export your progress in reality they dont let you access that feature without a premium membership i dont mind paying for features and services but keeping your data behind a paywall is dirty id recommend finding a foss habit tracker
2,very simple ui potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time some may like it scaled back look can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying seems costly for the simplicity of the app
2,only the premium version is good for use free version is a waste of time
2,only 3 stars because after the first 5 options no more then u have to pay
2,can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation uninstalling
2,reminders havent been working
2,i like this app i bought the premium version last year and i still cant synchronize my data i have to change my phone and i will lose all the data could you fix that
2,man this app is great simple but complete which makes it very effective customization options for habits are excellent and connecting to specific communities a huge plus highly recommended if you want to keep track of your progress towards a goal updated logging features are still as good as ever but since syncing is impossible i cant see the forum anymore as my user doesnt properly log in and there is no customer service i cant recommend it anymore
2,i bought a premium subscription but i cant get my devices syncing im quite disappointed
2,sync no longer working
2,edit initially gave it 45 stars the app itself still works fine but the sync stopped working about a year ago thats the main reason i paid for the premium version i messaged the developer about it and never heard back wonder if its been abandoned by the developer
2,seems like it could be very helpful getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though i have weekly view selected in settings even tried switching it but no matter what opens on monthly
2,i liked it when i first got it several years ago but after installing it on several devices i found it does not sync with the other instances of it after getting no response from their support desk i uninstalled the three apps from the three devices and reinstalled them using my google account in case i had not logged in with the same account on all the three new instantiations do not sync the help desk is nonexistent the idea is good but the app is defective
2,very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit the only downside is that you cant sync the app as it says no internet connection when there absolutely is also together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes its just gone previous rating was 5 stars but with this bug continuing for half a year now i can only give 2 stars
2,widget freezes app does not sync i had a galaxy s7 edge and just got an s10 app fails with both phones regret spending money on this
2,unable to import any data from the csv file in cloud no option to get any data back bought premium and im not happy beware
2,cant see new topics of discussion also cant add discussion topic even though i have excellent internet connection wi fi or data please fix i have no connection issues with any of my other apps
2,loading takes too long and reminders dont work
2,unable to log in unable to create a new account or link to facebook
2,the moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired needs better moderation
2,sync no longer works also app has been buggy lately  closes down and does not respond im now using loop habit tracker which is more stable
2,hello habitbull team i need to check all features in premium version so can you give me access to premium version for 2 days so that i can try all features and check if the feature that i need is present or not and then buy premium version
2,ive been using this app for more than 5 years it was great but currently i changed my phone and found out that syncing doesnt work anymore  it says something like no internet connection so at the end i have to use another app
2,i really like this app enough to purchase the premium a few years back but the app didnt update to premium for me and there was no response when i contacted the support seems like im not alone in this experience dont put your trust in the developers
2,mixed great app but dont by premium wont work without play services and developer unresponsive
2,editupdate  purchased premium sync doesnt work a quick glance at developers fbtwitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the earth no activity since 2018 app hasnt received an update since 2018 my suggestion pick an app thats still actively developed exactly what i have been looking for fantastic interface and thoughtful design im hooked guys
2,worked fine for months now it doesnt track habits the way i set them it treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how i have set it up going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app
2,the motivational messages are annoying you can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more good riddance i suppo this kind of app is just not for me
2,the tracker itself is not bad but i set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them i already checked my settings all is good its nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working
2,cant choose when to start i like setting goalshabits for advance dates once im done with one also you cant edit a habitgoal to start over you have to delete and start new doesnt save your previous habitsgoals to do again
2,i liked the app until it told me i could only have 5 goals 
2,the only part of this app that doesnt impress me is the widgets everything else is beautiful good visual layouts simple quick tracking but enough features to be flexible for different needs update 12302019 the app no longer syncs and does not import data ive got a handy cvs export with 3000 lines of habit data thank goodness but can no longer reccomend the app if it requires manual input to restore data
2,i had to buy this app because i need that larger widget to fit my needs and you cannot test it out with the free version sadly its too buggy to be of any use at least on the aio launcher still overall better than my last habits tracker but i feel ripped off
2,customer support is completely unresponsive i purchased the upgraded version and it doesnt sync as promised there has been no help on fb email nada kinda sucks tbh the app is nice the android widget is what makes it great plz fix the sync issue and ill update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me
2,only 5 items on free version would be nice to have that clear so i dont have to waste my time and give out my email
2,love and use the app but sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing
2,worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders the reminders would pop up if i opened the app myself but thats obviously not the point of a reminder also froze a lot pretty much useless when it worked it was excellent
2,cant sync i paid to have the ability to make more tasks but thats about all its good for
2,i really think the math is off on this logically it does not make sense that if you have a good day your percentage of success goes up by 1 but if you have a bad day it goes down 20 that really defeats the point of motivation and self forgiveness
2,the app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating i paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good
2,used to be a great app but ive moved phones but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost even after having paid 18 for premium very much a shame
2,i was testing this to replace fabulous so far the notifications are not persistent enough fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning
2,do not buy premium version app stopped synching 7272019 and is no longer supported i got premium to sync to new phone since ive been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking 10 wasted very disappointing because basic version is great  simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits good visuals and the ability to make notes premium  tracking 5 habits and syncing across devices but no more would be 4 stars if still supported and worked
2,having trouble syncing on new device says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong
2,while i can understand limiting somethings for premium only ive never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if i can keep track of things on the homescreen maybe i would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there
2,too much fluff difficult to see the actual progress
2,i bought the premium and i cant sync the data between my devices
2,syncing devices doesnt work even after reading and applying suggestions in the faq of the website
2,good design simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details however they dont respond to emails and havent released an update in over a year seems like this project was abandoned
2,ive set a reminder for me to drink water it doesnt remind at all
2,app hasnt been updated cant sync cant import habits this was a good app shame that i have to switch
2,great app in the beginning but once you start skipping days the notifications become insulting shaming words for example calling me a couch potato which i am not so dumb what expert would ever say that insults are motivational almost none id rather use an app based on the principle of kindness not shaming
2,the app is good to use overall except as a number of other folks have said it does not sync and there is no response from the developer on this issue annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature when it doesnt actually work what that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone
2,really 8 for a habit tracker there are other apps that do the same thing for far less money i dont mind paying for apps but this seems like price gouging oh and its 10 if you want the ability to export your data
2,it seems like this app is no longer supported ive paid for premium but sync stopped working several months ago and developers have not replied to a support request so  on moving to a new phone  my habits and streaks are now lost i can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue i guess the app has now been abandoned
2,the app is constantly loading and you cant even record your habits and reminders dont work also having just 5 habits free is bad too
2,paid widget feature one thing that downplays all other
2,i like how the app has options to write notesjournals for each day it gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits most other apps dont have this feature that said im rating the app two stars because the notifications dont work for me i have set times for reminders throughout the day but the app sends me random notifications reminders when i dont want them and on other days no notifications at all no app updates from the developer in over a year either
2,does not sync
2,worked okay for awhile sync between devices no longer works and i have the paid for premium account uninstalled on both devices sync fails on both
2,i liked the app and i purchased it but i cant sync any data from old phone and when logged out of the app there is no way to login again except reinstall the app so if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone this app is for you but since i like to keep my progress to the new phone i am stop using this app and find another one
2,no notification of habit tracks
2,good app but dont bother with premium i bought premium for the powerful widgets and ability to track extra habits dont bother the widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says its best to only track a few habits at a time after feeling ripped off i emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply great free app but dont waste your money on premium
2,desde hace unos meses no sirve la sync ni me deja entrar a la cuenta
2,generalle good and easy to use unfortunately the syncbackup feature seems to be broken so i cant transfer habits to a different device the csv export is also useless as theres bo way to open it in a different device
2,cannot sync what is going on
2,the app doesnt really look like the screenshots its also quite outdated in design if you dont mind paying for it then it gets the job done
2,im changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work looking at the last update i feel like the developer had abandoned this apps which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit
2,slow updates bugs
2,please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app i cant live without this feature
2,not a bad app but dont pay for the premium the widgets dont work
2,app is very good for what it is but the sync feature stopped working for me the faq says its due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on nonrooted phones habitbull offers no support to fix 2 stars bec it works standalone but if you need syncing know theres a risk of permanent failure
2,unable to register via manual and via fb
2,i like that it allows specific habits i dont like that it does not give proper percentages of how much youve done your habits after using it about a month i deleted it because even though i was doing almost every habit 100 it kept giving me 50 it was demoralizing
2,a little too confusing
2,the app requires premium membership to use the widget defeats the point for me
2,i m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit buildinglets see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get dots connected in pattern thats not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward
2,worked really well however the widgets work for a day then wont respond unless removed and readded   eevveerryy day wont remember to actually use it without the widgets so its useless now not worth paying extra
2,couldnt login with facebook
2,it is completely failing on reminders
2,i regret buying the premium version a lot of money for only a minor update i wish i could get a refund do not buy the premium version from the app it doesnt worth your money
2,i upgraded to pro after a couple of weeks  initially excited about the app having used it for a while now im starting to regret my purchase there are some pros but more cons its buggy doesnt sync well at all across devices the ui is very cluttered the forum needs serious updating a search tool for eg the last update was ages ago given how pricey this is youd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared
2,please change the logo
2,i like this app but one thing that i hate  why do i have to be member of premiums  i mean why do i have to pay   if i want to track up more than 5 habit  this is a free app right  please can you consider or change something about it
2,this would be great if it didnt require me to mark negatives in other words it requires me to mark everyday i did not do something such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol this is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because i dont want to have to check everything that didnt happen this could be much better if it assumes i didnt drink or smoke if i didnt make any mark for that day or at least give me the option to do it this way
2,bought premium version didnt get upgrade sent proof of payment still no response not good
2,the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free
2,its not worth the premium i tried to get a refund because it wasnt what i thought it would be and no one has contacted me they claim to read every single email but cant reply to a paid customer i will be deleting this app and regretting the 8 purchase
2,well it is good and motivational but i dont get notifications for the reminder moreover you have to pay for the widget
2,there needs to be an option on when the habit starts
2,awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of 5 its about 10 for me with tax included also i dont appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33 claimed discounted price very deceiving lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019
2,used to be my favorite app changed phones and it doesnt recognize my premium purchase ive been emailing for support for two months with no response so disappointed
2,too much configuration not very intuitive im looking for something simple that only counts something for the day not to set goals reminders notes and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen not looking for enterprise app just for personal use
2,i could not figure out how to set reminders and i did not want to register
2,password reset is broken cannot transfer it to a new cell phone think twice before buying this app the habitrelated side is good however  this is why i bought it
2,i love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit other apps force you to commit to specific days the flexibility in this app helps me succeed what i hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completionfor example i did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull
2,free version is all you need paid version is overpriced and a waste of google credits
2,i love the ease of the application and the setup i dont like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shamebased it doesnt make me want to try any harder when i get scolded for not fulfilling my goals positive encouragement as the best way
2,i want to start my week with saturday and it is not available only can change between sunday  monday 
2,useless you need a premium account to use widgets
2,i had my phone switched off one day at the time my reminder usually pops up ever since then ive not got notifications at all no matter if i try reset them or whatever kinda annoying because the calendar app on my phone has also stopped giving notifications lately so i keep forgetting to take my medication
2,started off really well but has stopped working properly now great shame as it has a lot of promise
2,crashes on sign in on my pixel 2 xl
2,stuck on setting up your account
2,great app but waaay to complicated deleted it and replaced with a different simpler app interface looks cool though
2,reminders are not working i have an asus zenfone 4 shouldnt matter and i have set the reminders multiple times with no success i feel this is the most important part of this app as i need reminding in order to affectively create a habit any feedback would be greatly appreciated my rating my change after feedback
2,its misleading to list data export as a reason to buy premium when it is not included with premium it would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system additionally the platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33 off the greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33 off price will give higher star review when these are fixed
2,too expensive and without paying theres no backup theres free apps that do the same thing
2,two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year is this application still supported by the dev team
2,widget request please could you add a feature that pushes undone tasks to the top of the widget or an option that removes done tasks from the widget   good job on the app otheriwise ill repurchase if you can add this love the snooze function
2,only a few habits for free not worth paying for
2,free version gives only 5 habits there are far clearer and better trackers available for free
2,fine for tracking but the reminders stop working after a couple of weeks this has happened with every new habit ive set up and i have a premium account and the developer doesnt respond to support requests
2,none of the notifications work other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications
2,i would not recommend this app bc of an essential flaw in design  it doesnt allow you to just type in habit instead it quizzes you so a simple act of just typing what youd like to do turns into this crazy and overly complicated thing
2,free version allows only up to 5 habits to be added but app description doesnt mention it had to spend an hour setting up habits then uninstall the app and find a new one
2,i dont like the layout at all i want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks
2,the motivation pics stopped at some level and dont want to be changed pls solve this issue
2,the app is ok however i purchased the premium version and once i switched phones could no longer get the premium version back emailed the developers for help and they ignored the emails
2,i loved the app and purchased it to help my son keep up with studying i paid for the premium account which indicates you can log in on multiple devices both ios and android after setting it up on my phone which was easy but took some timewhen i tried logging onto my sons phone it didnt recognize the account i contacted customer service but didnt hear back its a nice app really like the features so this was really disappointing i could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone its not helpful i still hope someone can help me fix this or i should get a refund for my purchase
2,love the app would love a version for windowschrome to use on pc also i bought a premium version and now when i opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the nonpremium version
2,paid for this years ago and used it on another device now i have a new phone and when im trying to login it says my email address is not in the database
2,it stops sending notifications randomly
2,after changing my email i cannot use habitbulls premium features i have tried emailing supportno responseand finding a way to restore the purchase or even purchase it again but no such luck i am forever stuck with the app thinking i have pro even though i do not its a shame really for what is otherwise a fantastic app
2,good concept with poor design the widget needs a redesign  currently it wastes a lot of space on my homescreen the forum section is good
2,i buy the platinum app but the reminders doesnt work please fix it  its a great app but the reminders are very important to me
2,i like the overall app it is the best but even after setting the reminder for my habits i do not receive any notification or reminder i have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on
2,please dont call me darling my app reminder called me darling not cool
2,works ok on galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications cant even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts in the end all data lost and so am i
2,free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing
2,only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to pay for more always about the money sorry i wasted time on setting this up
2,almost 3 years ago i liked it enough to purchase it then they decided to make it a monthly fee i found this out when i reloaded it onto my phone i emailed them to find out if my previous purchase was valid or if it was applicable to the new version and they never responded even a simple no would have been fine so i found another habit tracker that i actually prefer
2,had annoyances with the ui the font was too big for me and i couldnt see a lot of things at once and for all its gimmicks its really just a simple app
2,didnt like it
2,lost my premium and all my habits gone when i changed my device the app was great but doesnt seem good for long term use
2,the fact that with the free version doesnt let someone track more than 5 habits its a shame
2,worked for about a day and then just crashed repeatedly so have uninstalled disappointed as looked really good
2,i think its really petty that the widget only comes with a premium account no thanks
2,id give it five stars but it keeps bugging me to rate it
2,"pointless to be honestmay as well use a notebook doesnt track habits 
yes you have to manually do everythingmy time is to valuable to waste 
on this garbage"
2,"perfect purchased it though i really really wish for a chrome extension 
so that i can access it on my computer too edit like many others my 
premium account is gone too i dont mind purchasing it again but what if 
it goes missing again"
2,"i would give 5 but the reminder is not working and i wish the app had a 
way to report such bugs uninstalled"
2,sir  actually some time it doesnt pop reminder  i dont know why
2,"i have purchased full version of this app the functionality of the app is 
good but many features are not working properly eg starup on montly view 
is not working additionally there is absolutely zero response from the 
developers on reporting the bugs"
2,"app was well organized and easy to use but you had to pay money to have 
more than 5 habits to track not realistic for me to only need 5 
uninstalled it"
2,"please help me i really like this app but my premium purchase with my 
facebook account is gone recently i have trouble with the app it stops 
everytime i opens then i uninstall and reinstall it again but it 
continues to stop it turns out that the problem is i disabled chrome 
because after i installed and update chrome the habit tracker worms again 
however my premium purchase is gone and i cant seem to redeem it"
2,"this app is crashing whenever i try to mark as task completed on a 
particular date"
2,constantly tells me to provide a rating
2,"like the way it presents the stats would like to suggest a collaboration 
concept with other users such as via google where one can view and 
comment hisher mates lists"
2,"app is great but it crashes on month view and when trying to edit habit on 
my xiaomi redmi note 4"
2,"like the app but dont like how i purchased premium on one device and cant 
get my premium features anywhere else"
2,sync isnt working lost my data again
2,"sorry for the poor rating but your app has a major bug swiping up or down 
while viewing details for a monthhabit makes the interface jump to details 
for another habit randomly its a pain to realise midway that suddenly you 
are reading incorrect data happens so many times that its not funny will 
be looking for alternatives to your app"
2,"great design except they hide the fact you can track 5 on the free version 
until you go through the process of adding all five individually then you 
find out you cant add anymore without premiuthem freemium is fine hiding 
the cut off wall is not"
2,"this is a great app it gets two stars because i paid for it but it 
frequently nags me to review it well heres your review"
2,cluttered and unintuitive
2,the app crashes and closes when trying to sync i have the platinum plan
2,"has great potential but it kept crashing when i clicked the monthly view or 
the weekly view also reinstalled the app and when i created my first 
habit it crashed again"
2,"too spammy repeated notifications pushing for a rating i rated then 
uninstalled"
2,"i paid for this app yet it stopped working after i logged out one time it 
refuses to let me back in when trying my password and even after i tried 
changing the password multiple times there is no contact information on 
their website "
2,"habit sync does not work i must create the same account over and over 
again frustrating"
2,"not interested in peoples masterbation habits the community news feed was 
full of people tracking their jerking off  no thanks dont want to 
know uninstalled"
2,only track 5 habits for free
2,"pretty nice app but unstable a bit sometimes drops settings like show 
monthlyweekly and a big trouble used it for 3 month had troubles with 
signing up at start and gave up  i used it without account just on one 
phone about a week ago received strange email about password from support 
they have my email but didnt sign me in looked strange frankly 
speaking so i ignored the email and decided to try to register one more 
time i used option sign up with facebook was glad to see title without 
data loss and when i finally registered all my habits and data 
disappeared from interface sent email to support with screens and 
description but silence still"
2,"its a good app but just list my premium account and all my data luckily i 
saved it how do i get it back"
2,great functionality though app forces you to login or create an account
2,good app if i could track more than just 5 if i want to track morei have to pay for it no thanks not worth it
2,same as other recent posts  paid for premium got a new phone  it wont sync wont recognize email  wont accept user name and zero response from support  i have emailed them 4 times and cannot get any response also the sync does not work
2,the reminders never work
2,"it has all the features but it doesnt work properly i have a 5 days 
streak and it says 7 i have 3 and ut counts as 0 there are major errors 
here and its frustrating"
2,widgets require premium
2,it doesnt let you have more than 5 habits without getting premium
2,they want 499 not just once for a program that is pretty much automated but they want 499 a month for something you could keep on google sheets or whatever else you could imagine and its crossplatform stupidly optimistic no thanks
2,i paid for premium some time ago just got a new phone and installed the app and was unpleasantly surprised to find that my email address was not found in our database this apparently means that all my synced data habits and history are completely gone i created a new profile with the same email address but the app still does not appear to be syncing at all ill continue to use the app for now as i still like it best out of all habit trackers but be warned there is no backupsync support here
2,how can i delete my account all i see is an option for deleting data
2,worked until i upgraded to premium now i cant change my user name cant write comments or add discussions its not syncing to my phone please fixs its been less than 24hrs since i upgraded
2,does not load
2,until recently i enjoyed the app but somehow my purchased premium status is not recognized anymore contacted the developers by email but got no response so sad 
3,i bought the premium version and sometimes a habit wont chainlink between successful days you have to delete and recreate it then it will chainlink between successful days again
3,android widget not working it shows the tasks but when i click on the circle to mark it as done nothing happens
3,ive had this app for a long time but only just started using it it works well enough for what i need keeping track of the things i need to do i think the free options are quite reasonable to although as with most apps there is a paid optionversion too
3,its a great app when the notifications work but im still not getting notification reminders so ill be dropping stars on my review till this changes ive checked my phone settings but theres nothing blocking them my phone samsung s20
3,widget only for premium account
3,the motivational photo is missing
3,whyd it log me out edit the push notifications dont push anymore
3,i love this app but the widget doesnt work most times which is very annoying
3,i dont know how its work i wanna give it 5stars but when alarm is once set and when it rangbit dosnt stop untill u switch off the phone
3,hello i can see that beneath by habits theres supposed to be an image that never loads i just see a white square with an image icon on top left corner can it be fixed
3,nice visuals but its not worth 5month i really wanted something for hydrating and this works but not inthe way i needed
3,decent app for habit tracking unsubscribing from their premium membership is a headache
3,almost perfect however the widget bugs out and freezes as soon as you try to make the daily bigger than the far to small preset sizing also needs to allow for a oneoffto do list similar to how habitica has a dailies habits and then one off list
3,nice app but need to fix some bugs first app crashes when i click on go premium also even if i am connected to wifi some big image is not loading on home screen wondering whats that image
3,its good for what i needed simple good stats like the for color coding dont really need the chats on topics i dont look at or use that i wanted more than 5 items on my list and the widget for easy tracking on my home screen the widget only works sporadically to check off an item thats annoying considering i paid the one time fee apparently its known issue shouldve readmore reviews and maybe not purchased
3,it is great for keeping track of my habits but i never get any reminders ive checked my phone and all the permissions are there but still no reminders i just get a tiny message that tells me the app is running but disappears without doing anything ill persevere a bit longer but if it doesnt remind me there isnt much point as i will forget to do things
3,too costly for premium
3,in theory it helps track habits but after 30 or 40 days the reminders stop appearing randomly then just disappear completely rest of the app works well perhaps its my device but be aware
3,not used
3,super easy to use less friction i like how users can discuss progress with each other its very helpful
3,looks like a powerful tool but the ui is a dealbreaker for me hopefully it receives a major redesign in the future
3,over priced under developed app the free version only allows for tracking five habits and the premium version is about 5 a month the app lacks the polish off others available for less and feels more like a beta than a final product in the end i found a better app thats completely free has more features and a cleaner ui my advice to the developer is to ditch the subscription model or make it less expensive and annual
3,without upgrading to premium can only track up to 5 habits
3,the widget stops responding you have to open the app to make it respond again paid to have the widget widget doesnt work read some reviews and see this is a known issue should have done my homework better
3,its okay premium version is more useful
3,it is a good app ive been using it for quite some time and i think i m progressing and this really is helping me just a bit dissapointed bcs it doesnt have a full progress tracker as a graph and i wish they will install this feature nearby in the future hopefully
3,not great but good enough to track habit and keep record read atomic habits to understand and learn the how and use this app to keep track should yield a better result reminder not working
3,its about what id expect from a habit tracker i chose this over another one for the motivational quotes only they just just up as the error picture icon without the actual picture if i cant get the picture can i at least get alternative text for the picture that has the quote moto z2 force
3,i wish there are better graphs to see the dips and raises in my performance the current one is way too compressed and looks just like a straight line inspite of the dips
3,the app is great now some bugs are fixed notificationreminders still dont work for me 699month seems steep to record more than 5 habits
3,no resent updates cloud based  csv export is avaliable in only pro no option to manually mark skip fail but we can select targets like less than or greater than too cant select date range in graphreport local data importexport is missing habits can be archived but categorygroup is missing multi device sync is avaliable a very good alternative to habithub
3,i think i like it but not fully sure yet was getting daily notifications then they stopped and i forgot all about some habits will restart again
3,the app design could be better
3,great app  could you guys add a option like task archive because there are some habits like typing practice i want to follow and dont want to delete the data give a option to hide the habit without losing data
3,good but notifications not working
3,i was unable to create checklists in the way i want im better off using microsoft excel
3,works fine free version a bit limited now notifications have stopped hope the developers fix it soon
3,nice one but its expensive
3,i love this app but my premium service doesnt seem to follow me i sent multiple emails to get it resolved however im only getting autogenerated response emails
3,why is it called habit bull upon installation and it also has a different app icon misleading
3,good app but it doesnt have riminder as it says
3,the app wasnt able to sync anymore and as much as i know the app wasnt supported by its developer ps i bought its premium version it was great not until they havent keep it updated
3,nice and easy way to keep track of your streaks and habits also pretty cool that there are comment boards so you can interact with people doing the same things nice to get encouragement and share tips really cool app overall
3,i cannot logout or change my password what if i change my phone then i wouldnt be able to load my data into the new one why is it that i cannot register my email
3,pretty good app
3,beautiful app  always opens to bad news  overall percentage failure rather than positive streaks of even one day  willing to upgrade with habit app 
3,everything is perfect except for the fact that daily reminders on habit check feature doesnt work
3,not totally friendly environment
3,pretty good app but the continuous nagging to rate it in the play store gets annoying in a hurry
3,very good app for tracking habits and notes to add but lots of bugs to saypercentage is not correct alwaysit calculates own and no sync no ui improvement thanks
3,i like the alerts  its a good free app i think it be nice if i could click the day then get an option for if i completed my task or not
3,still learning to use it
3,its good easy to use
3,paid for it its alright if you dont use the widget constantly freezes and needs refreshing
3,a great app the one probpem it has is that if you missed a single day youll never get 100 no matter what so it seems like if you missed one day although you continue the next day all is fruitless its discouraging
3,its a good experience and a great challenge as well  you should try it
3,would need an ui refresh
3,wish i could track more than 5 habits without paying
3,the app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working i have bought the pro version
3,great app just cant justify spending 8  10 in order to track more than 5 habits when there are other apps out there i dont need to pay for to do so im switching to loop habit tracker can track as many habits as i want and back everything up all while being entirely free plus its really nice
3,the concept has had an extremely positive effect on my life however i am experiencing bugs with the widgets where exercises are disappearing restarting hasnt helped
3,could be a great app except that like another user said it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can thats a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices and when i switched phones i couldnt sync the app up with my data or any habits ive been tracking even though i have the premium account when attempting to sync it always says that there is no internet connection but there always is so i cant give it a full 55 rating otherwise i might
3,i think it could be more userfriendly but maybe i havent explored it enough it keeps asking for a rating maybe it will stop now
3,i actually really love this app i used it to create some serious personal progress i purchased the full app but when i bought a new phone it wouldnt let me sign out of my old device and into my new device i emailed support about itcrickets never heard from them if they can put together a decent support team i would give the app a 5 for sure
3,theres this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons please fix it
3,everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
3,best habit tracker  edit can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph its not accurate always trending down no matter what
3,in this free version we can add 5 habits only
3,please fix app cannot refresh once again for the second time  topics  pic quote
3,facebook login not working
3,i am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty 
3,can only track 5 habits but there are discussion forums most of the forums have no activity going on but there are still a few users to talk to often times the app no longer syncs me to them just like right now the quotes have been stuck too developers no longer support this app do not buy the premium version as you will not be able to sync across devices there are no more updates or customer support this could have been the absolute best habit tracking app so much wasted potential
3,this deserves 5 stars but i am not able to see discussions since the last one week
3,probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous
3,great app lots of ads
3,navigation needs work you can only navigate with the many buttons in the app the back button closes the app feature request has weekly and monthly report would like a daily report to share with an accountability partner also would be great to generate report based on category
3,great app so long as you only use the free version which only tracks 5 x habits used the free version for a couple of weeks then paid 949 for the platinum version so i could sync to other devices really disappointed that the sync option wont work and software support is non existent for an expensive app i would expect the developers to be as helpful as possible when a customer has an issue but they have completely ignored my request for help
3,i really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track simple but effective i used the free version for almost 2 years at the end of the first year it reset and i lost all of my history so before the end of the second year i bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again i contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all i still recommend it for tracking your habits but dont expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it
3,really enjoying this app but wish i could track more than 5 habits
3,too invasive and complicated
3,this is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken the score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database this means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day when if you did the thing you got 100 as such the visualizations are useless a better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals
3,full package for idr 139000 got a 33 discount but still idr 139000
3,it delivers what it promises
3,its a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits i had been gifted premium early on but ive found that the features have disappeared and im only seeing the base version i like it enough that i want to buy it but i worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews ive also found a bug when i have a goal set to 3x a week as success the app doesnt recognize when ive had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section whereas its at 80 in the percent success section and many weeks of meeting my goal
3,its good app but its not free if you want to add more than 5 habit
3,odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally
3,overall great app but it never gives me notifications so it kind of defeats the purpose of having it
3,the interface is intuitive i am giving a three because my online data did not sync when i upgraded
3,no of activities that we can add is only 5 thats why i give this 3 
3,i wish one could back up his habits otherwise it a good  straight forward app
3,syncing doesnt work still no reply from support
3,hello i recently shifted to a new phone i have a premium membership but i am unable to transfer my data to the new phone please help
3,this app is good but i cant access 5 habit because i need premium to access it 
3,i think the app is very good has helped me to keep track of my habits however i wish there was a function whereby you could postpone a habit for something out of your control ie not going to the gym because youre on holiday this although a break from the habit doesnt feel like it should affect the moments when you are focused and in control of keeping the habit also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week
3,does exactly one thing  tracks habits  but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras or ads clean interface sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work no way to transfer data
3,i liked how i could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps i had to input myself and my notifications would only go off if i opened the app myself kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications
3,the sync feature doesnt work
3,limited functionality but reliable
3,went for the premium subscription without a doubt definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly edit everythings good but after changing phones ive suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesnt work
3,the app is great i wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things for me the notifications dont work unles i open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed other then that easy app to use and navigate
3,dont get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times
3,just changed phone didnt keep anything from my premium account cant even create a new account without erasing current data 2 for that inconvenience  has helped me tremendously develop new habits ui is perfect the app and widgets allow quick and easy habit tracking counting habits are useful but it would be great to be able to see near misses in order to track improvement better customization of the interval chosen to calculate percentages would be very helpful
3,pretty average app
3,the reminder option is not workingi have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but unfortunatelythe basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent workkindly help by resolving this issue color code options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit
3,a great way to track goals but quite limited in functionaliry and the google fit integration doesnt work
3,habit syncing not working on paid version app is great but after phone resets and all my habits data of 2 months is lost and the app is showing i dont have a internet connection even though i am writing this review on same internet connection but other than that app works great  the widget is great and i use it daily
3,could do with a reward or goal feature when habit followed
3,its an okay app but i have found better ones such as i am sober this needs to be paid for to be useful
3,the app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that i have logged in 
3,lots of unnecessary notifications the gui is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app like splurging only every x days but no less
3,the free app is too limited other than that its a good one
3,doesnt save habit data when you switch to a new phone even using the same login information wont let me choose a start date for my habit either so it never shows 100 success like it should
3,the setup seemed nice but the constant pop ups are so annoying as to make it unusable
3,so far its not flexible enough for me also there needs to be an option to remove general discussion  from the dash board there seems to be a startling number of people with goals surrounding masturbation and porn and i just dont need to see that when im trying to inspire myself to play more music im going with the stars as a benefit of the doubt as i havent given it much time but i cant see me using this
3,i just started using this app my week actually starts with saturdays while only sundays and mondays are mentioned if you could modify this detail thatd be really appreciated 
3,i like this app and what it can do and am pleased with its functionality however having paid for the premium version i find it annoying beyond belief that i get popups every 2 weeks asking me to leave a review so developers ive left one but youve lost 15 stars for spamming me with these requests this shouldnt happen in a paid app without any opportunity to turn off these notifications
3,synching between my chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app the color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive
3,app is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot dont opens the app evertime i need to log out and again log in it plz solve my issue
3,when you start a habit with giving points for it or like at least that and that amount of days you cant just change it back to a simple yes and no habit
3,i really like this application very well done  my reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security no option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information  please add security
3,good app but faulty notifications the notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if i open the app by that point its too late i need the reminders to work to be effective i purchased the full version
3,dont buy the premium the widgets dont work the reason i bought premium and i set up notifications for each hour to remind me of a task but the notifications only pop up if you open the app which render the notifications useless otherwise i enjoy the basic use of the app
3,its ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages dont change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker the apps look doesnt come exciting to look at as well
3,i paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation they fix that problem
3,shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly otherwise all around good app
3,its a great app and works great helps me keep track of whether or not i took pills or did excercises or not however it lacks the feature of multiple times a day so if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day this app wont help since you can only click that you did it once does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature
3,i bought the paid verison it does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers but habits arent as simple as it is we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time if i want to develop a habit of waking up by 7 it shouldnt be a yes or no question i should be able to enter the time track it over the month
3,i really like the app maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more
3,the best app around for tracking habits but the artificial limitation to 5 habits in the free version coupled with the eyegouging price of the pro version lost it two stars i paid but i am not happy with the price
3,good app but only counts by day 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well
3,great format and tracking 7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget also people have a form of spirituality rather than a religion can that not be reflected in the app too for inclusivity removing forum comments would be a great option an unnecessary distraction
3,nice but no daily notification come
3,unable to set custom notification sound it uses default sound even after changing others looks good
3,notifications do not show up thought i have enabled all permissions and to override dnd the notifications and reminders do not work
3,i have noticed when i write notes and leave the app to find out more info the app locks which is fine but what i have written before i leave the app is not saved which can be very annoying there isnt even a warning or option to save before you leave the app
3,good function weird execution the program works great but it has weird way of reminding the user of the habit like saying hey tiger its just weird
3,i love the concept of habit bull but it isnt user friendly
3,good app minus one star because of the constant nagging and thats in the paid version 
3,ok app
4,great for progress their motivation quotes stopped working plus it doesnt remember which habit you were last viewing so a pain in the ass weekly intrusive display i specifically looked for this app because its simple and easy on the eyes
4,great for creating or breaking habits thanks so much
4,does what it should do just a shame that you need to pay almost 9 to add more than 5 habits for such a simple application i think this is way too much
4,solid habit tracking app great for what i needed it for
4,works great i use it for almost everything especially when taking a new medicine or starting a new thing i want to continue
4,works well and i love the cheery greetings
4,it has been effective in trcking my habits though i feel like the user interface can be a bit complicated and confusing at times overall it works
4,nice app it has help me improve in my diet work among others habits however there are some bugs which need to be fixed for a better experience for example i set a habit for only friday but it shows up everyday yet i only wanted it to show up on friday other it would receive 5 stars
4,would love to see a yearly review  other than that awesome app
4,nice app i wish there was an option to move a goal though for example i want to workout 3 days a week this app has you choose 3 set days i dont necessarily know my schedule and would like to move around a goal otherwise i dig
4,this is a great app easy to use
4,i really like this app but after changing from ios to android am not getting notification motivational images quotes there is some issue please fix it
4,best habit app but that will be superb if there adde audio instructions of habits that we add
4,have used this app for almost two years i loved the minimalistic features despite all other confusing apps out there it would be great if worked on making it an aesthetic user interface 
4,i really like the app however few weeks ago ive changed my phone for new one  samsung galaxy a51 and now ive problems with a widget sometimes it is posible to check that habits are done with the widget and sometimes it is not it looks like the widget just freeze can you help me
4,very good for habit maker
4,i like it for a free app
4,helpful for building habits
4,the only complaint i have is that the widget doesnt always respond if i dont have the app open in the background otherwise i love this  makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to see a slew of green checkmarks on my screen 
4,very good app to track good habits
4,the inspiration posters are not loadingviewable
4,when i add time to the habit it is in decimal so week and month totals are incorrect eg 130  140 is according to app 270 while it is 310 actually
4,the app helps me a lot i would like to have more information about the action and habits tracking into an online dashboard
4,i enjoy watching my habits become habits everyday i just wish there was a theme i could use
4,good for me
4,great app the app seem to have been abandon or just neglected by the creator but overall this a great app
4,good simple app but sometimes it doesnt download
4,great app but the daily picture does not work
4,works very well
4,can we please add number of days per fortnight as an option to select along with week month and year
4,just started using this i like it so far there is a broken image on the main screen display so i am not sure if i am missing something there does any one else see this
4,pretty useful and very helpful but it seems like its not being developed any further could have a lot more great features
4,it would be 5 stars but i regularly have issues getting the widget to work any suggestions
4,theres a square with a broken picture and a share button green thumbs up and a red thumbs down on the bottom
4,the tracking system is good
4,easy to use and customize only 5 habits without premium payment
4,simple interface easy to use and efficient except for the price
4,concept is great  helpful but alarms are not well synchronized when secured by password
4,like the app and ability to easily keep track of a habit but had difficulty figuring out how to keep track of it at first
4,simple yet powerful with a nice helpful community but i cant register for some reason it shows something went wrong please try in a bit
4,good application
4,very good app and it helped me to form habits
4,very basic but helps keep track of things
4,too overloaded main screen
4,app is nice but somehow i m not able to delete the habbit which i recently added by mistake pls guide
4,i love this app my only problem are the widgets for the app each widget freezes after nonuse for a while when the widget freezes i cant mark complete or incomplete update my counting numbers for any of the habits and then i have to physically open the app to update habits after i do that the widgets work again until the cycle repeats itself
4,efficient after setup makes tracking easy would like to be able to set incriments on each individual category not a plus or minus 1 only
4,very good could use some more flare 
4,i have had real problems remembering to do even simple things i have been using this app for 3 weeks and i have to say im pleased with the change
4,update on 81320 fixed the reminder notifications thank you
4,it is a great app maybe it could have a more attractive interface
4,good app to track your habits and build on good ones
4,this app is very good
4,good reminders for habit formation
4,helps me stay on track at least it used to since last update im not getting any of the reminders i set up please fix
4,a really easy way to track new habits i have looked at other apps and this is much easier thank you habitbull
4,a very simple habit tracker easy to use
4,great app really nice ui no major bugs ive come across feedback could you guys increase the character allowance for the notes please it can be frustrating to be recording notes for a day and have it run out of space thanks
4,so far so good it does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after ive exited the app though bit of a weird bug
4,motivational and funny remiders really help in pushing to do the task
4,the app is good but i think its need better graphs and charts
4,great tracker wish there were more colors to choose from especially if you have more than 8 habits youre tracking
4,best habit tracker ive used so far very flexible good data to work with i find it motivating and i love that i can chose exactly what i want to work on right away the price is also very very good for what it is thank you for not making it a monthly subscription the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because i love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy for example today i have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar  check off list sometimes you cant tick off
4,nice app the icon got problem
4,an improvement would be to see running total on all habits page quite expensive for what it does
4,good appbut they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits
4,great app easy to use custom colours and categories for each habit limited to 5 habits on the free version is the only gripe
4,i love this app i like how simple it is to use worth purchasing the only thing i wish is that it would open to the weekly spot instead of to a single habit maybe there is way to make that happen let me know but if you are looking for simple but great habit tracker i highly recommend this one
4,the best habit tracker app ive seen wouldve done 5 stars but i feel like somethings missing and i cant quite put my finger on it
4,its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict
4,very useful and encourages motivation
4,notification features should be free
4,very conveniant and useful the reminder function is also really nice to stay on top of activities
4,a straightforward nononsense app with a vibrant community ive found it very helpful to start to shape my habits thanks to the devs
4,easy to use and has helped me to keep track of my good habits
4,easy and convenient apps but the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best
4,nice to track challenges it gives its own incentive to keep those day trains going
4,loving it so far keeps me motivated 
4,good as motivation to track and tick off daily goals
4,a little hard to use at 1st however if you go through the tutorials the app will help you develop habits i have been using it for a month and am definitely noticing a difference if you want to change your habits download this app
4,good app no lags does what it says im happy
4,happy to see my progress its a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which i paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life
4,im a big kid id love it if the circles you tap to colour in were star shaped
4,its a quite useful program works reliably
4,if wish the images of quotes would have the previous option too
4,i like the app but dont like the big list of discussions about guys not trying to masterbate at the bottom
4,it helps me to change my habbit
4,simple but effective
4,wish it had a little more options but still great and easy app
4,this has been a great app to build habits i would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time you can get more but theres a pay wall
4,looks like its not supported anymore shame i used it for about a year and really liked it edit  looks like it works again no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions four stars because i liked it while i used it but i have found something better loop instead of once per week you can set a goal of once per  of days works better for me and is more useful
4,really good way of tracking habits and progress exercise and quality of babys sleep are my uses only 4 because there could be a little more on the customisation front even if only in the premium version perhaps id like to see something like a target for average number instead of passfail thatd provide an extra way of approaching habits i think im picking at hairs though its a very good app that does the job it advertises
4,great tool
4,very good quality app for habits
4,simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals
4,very helpful app for us to quitjoin any kind of habit with the help of this app i have now completed my 60 days of no smoking challenge thankyou habit bull
4,already helped a lot wish it had more colors
4,great for tracking your bad habits making new good ones and building a better lifestyle for yourself bought the full version for more habit tracking which is great if you are dedicated but 799 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits some inspirational quotes and a mediocre social system it has helped me better myself over the past week of using it so id highly recommend trying it at least in the limited free version before buying the full version
4,good better than the other apps
4,good habit tracking app
4,tracks many tasks in great detail statistics available on averages and streaks etc it has progressive tasks so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily like drinking water and come up with more info than passfail my only qualm is the color the display is very busy and colorful i would also like a quicker interface for progressive tasks
4,why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same
4,wonderful app im just wondering if i overlooked something because if for instance i set a habit to every 3 days but end up doing it every 2 days instead the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail which seems very strange to me since i actually did better than needed
4,this has been a pretty indispensable tool for me it motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes i would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise my personality requires checklists or ill find excuses to skip doing things
4,its a little too early to tell so far pretty good
4,really remarkable app
4,used it on  off for years motivational but not annoying like some nice design various views week month specific habit progress wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month all the stats you can set a date to achieve the goal app recommends like 60 i think discussion boards other features as well i just dont use them much all in all great app
4,get me focused and motivated
4,i liked this app it is really helping me and reminding me to do things on time and i am able to be proactive
4,a great app that helps create new habits or break bad habits if you want to set goals this is the app to use tried many of the same type of apps and this is by far the best  easiest to use
4,sehr hilfreich
4,home
4,im using this app since a week loving it so far i think some new cool features like challenges would be fun and engaging will make it 5 if that happens besides i recommend you to use this app for developing a new habit or skill the numbers makes you feel good about yourself
4,genial
4,can ui can be improved to add habits with more customisation
4,numerical entries should default to the previous days value
4,easy to use and helpful to keep good habits on track
4,cest bon
4,loved it motivates me to keep me on track with my set targets
4,i love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals theres only two things that could make this app better being able to disable decimals on specific habits to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made
4,bug has been fixed now i can use it with all my devices
4,using the free version and its easy intuitive and highly flexibleit reflects just what i want to track for five different tasks each week from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where i log time spent on these actions and notes too ive already recommended it
4,i have only been using this app for about six days however im really enjoying it i like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes its also affordable if you are more than five habits one thing i think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write aside from that i love it so  if it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five 
4,good app really helpfulbut i think it should include permanent tracker in the dropdown menu
4,great to get started with a healthier lifestyle
4,dear developers when syncing will be fixed thanks
4,great for keeping track of my workout and non drinking days
4,free and easy to track ur new habits
4,its a good app that lets us develop 5 habits if one isnt a pro user i think its a good idea to start small since developing a habit just one habit takes atleast 2 months if not mistaken overall satisfied
4,good one to keep up the momentum 
4,the app is simple  clean tracks habits efficiently the only reason i am giving 4 star is because reminder notifications arent working properly habit tracker please fix it
4,great its simple
4,good app to track habits
4,animations are a bit choppy and mediocre design but great functionality
4,only 5 hapits for free
4,this is the best app i have ever used to keep track of my activitiesthe greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives it will always remind you which is very motivating i only have one problem thoughhaving trouble with syncronising my progress which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again then all the progress i had saved would be lost so this one reason i give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5good app though
4,easy to use but it seems really basic
4,love it except i cant change the positive memes at the bottom anymore
4,great app i am using it for a while functionality wise it the best in the market it can get updated in terms of visuals and performance
4,uiux can be improved a bit more
4,i love it simple and effective is it right that the motivational pics dont switch anymore mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now 
4,i like the design
4,heyyy dear developers love the app but have a issue in it idk if it is only with me the app doesnt show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal only 1st day it does
4,in general this app helps me keep track of my habits which is great however the app has quite a few bugs even after buying the premium version which is disappointing the sync function doesnt work at all and i dont see any effort to fix these issues this is one of the rare apps where i wont be giving a 5 star review
4,very good and gets the job done not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst its exactly how its pictured and works fabulously too no crashing or issues here
4,good app tracks nicely good widget sometimes notifications can be a bit flaky
4,extremely easy user interface helpsnin using the app more and note the goals
4,simple easy to use makes it very easy to keep track of habits
4,i like the app have been using it for a few months now and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track only drawback ive found is the inability to sync my profile  always fails with sync failed make sure you have a working internet connection have sent in support request but so far no response that aside the app works well and i can still use it in standalone mode on my primary android phone
4,it is all for me about habits i wasnt able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i dont know if didnt find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i dont know if it in the app or not
4,amazing experience
4,app is great helps me keep track of my daily habits i like how the interface is simple and easy to use however ive been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget
4,the images with quotes wont change good app tho
4,best habit tracker app i have used
4,fun and engaging way to track your goals and form better habits im still not great at keeping up with it but the app works well when i spend the time to pay attention to it
4,easy to use and very flexible
4,great way to hold yourself accountable for setting goals
4,its cool because its gives me motivation to push myself and allow me to see my struggle in addiction for every day i fail
4,worked well for my purposes
4,nice app would like further customization for habits such as perhaps scores the better you tackle a habit healthier eating today than yesterday resulting in a higher score this would make the app much more useful for me otherwise great app
4,love the reminder to log your habits
4,great app quite simple it has a specific purpose but does it well
4,liked the setup so much that i quickly became a premium user the widget alone is worth it i love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when i can work on developing a habit as i am frequently adding habits i would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them hopefully this is an easy fix then this will be a 5star app
4,a good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life limited flexibility in the free version but sufficient four basic tracking of selfimprovement efforts easy to get started and so i can do without cute reminder and encouragement features they are easy enough to toggle off
4,works well the interface is a little odd you have to scroll down to see all the graphs
4,удобный наглядный трекер привычек с подробной кастомизацией к сожалению не всегда корректно срабатывают напоминания  во всплывающем окне не нажимаются кнопки приходится переходить в приложение чтобы отметить выполненное действие
4,havent been using it for a long time but so far so good however the paid version should have more features such a costomizing your own categories also the widget should be more customizable such as font size
4,this app seems to work pretty well the user forums arent well managed but remain useful habit tracker has never crashed on me but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the ui has focus at the time you launch the app fortunately its easy to navigate
4,simple app that provides all i need to track habits ui could use a refresher
4,this is closest to my expectations
4,i like this app i have used it for a while now and it helps only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating i managed 122 days straight but it wont change from 98 i think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100 also would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone just different colour so i can say 50 100 days etc as a motivator its great for a free app well done to the devs on this
4,love this app but it only lets you keep track of only 5 habits at once for more you have to buy premium but other than that its great
4,it works well for me
4,great app please add the ability to see when recurring habit is due or by automatically completing a habit which is not due ie required once a week for example
4,it would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbittry not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app  well built interface with motivational images loved it
4,using for a week now i like seeing the statistics and that the free version will track 5 habits
4,its useful
4,would be perfect if you also have pomodorotimer to do each task
4,good visual reminder and nice to see patterns of habit breaking
5,im using the app for about a week so far so wonderful 
5,it is perfect
5,simple and amazing app
5,really good app it actually helps me stay focused and on track with all the positive habits i have created for myself
5,wonder full app
5,i love how simple this is its helped me focus on those important things that i want to accomplish i just wish there was space for more than 5 free habits this means if you decide to track something else in that space then youll lose the data unless of course you write it down before changing it this is why it loses a star in my opinion its the best free habit tracker ive found a lot of other apps have free trials which i dont even bother with
5,at first seemed like a habit on w habit but now it is a part of my habits i find it indispensable today
5,yes its nice
5,sweet and simple
5,simple and useful youre allowed to track 5 habits for free upgrade for up to 100 habits best feature is that you can track a habit in terms of counts ie 3 times a week any day instead of every monday wednesday and friday quite a rare feature for most habit trackers
5,its easy to use and there is suggestion on how to use it efficiently
5,good application to keep a watch on habit and becomming sucessful in my opnion if you are sucessful for 90 days habit is created i am usuing again to review and creat habit
5,great and useful app
5,its amazing very useful i m happy to use it
5,simple  easy  exactly what i was looking for
5,easy to use and exactly what i was looking for in a goal tracker
5,its soooo good 
5,i tried to get back into meditating and exercisedrinking enough water etc but i couldnt fully commit to it all until i downloaded this app again im a perfectionist so i like to keep my habits completion at 100 
5,awesome app been using it to track my sobriety its been 38 years now best thing 5 habits tracking for free plus community support of like minded ppl great design and quotes and notifications this and habithub are my favourites cheers
5,মর বড় বশ ভল লগছ
5,i use it to track just a few things works nicely
5,life changing ive been using this app for 2 years and it has changed my lifestyle i actually bought the premium and i didnt regret it at all i love that it is intuitive the streak motivates you to keep doing i love that there are more rewards that comes with the streak for example if you reach 30day marked you should receive a badge or trophy just to keep us motivated

5,the best i tried 10 habit trackers wish it had edge screen implemented like habitsooz tracker its an app but also has edge screen so you can view all habits  checkuncheck them off quickly rather than having to leave current screen find the app open it  search for habits its there on my screen at all times just gotta swipe the edge screen handle to see edge screen is on samsung phones im sure all devs kno it i can send u screenshots what habitsooz edge screen looks like jst ask
5,pretty good app to track your habits

5,simple  effective ive used this a lot over the past few years  found it extremely helpful strongly recommend
5,it pushes me from my comfort zone to do something important
5,user friendly interface been using this for quite some time and so far i like it as a free version easy to use and does its job like others i dont really use the chat but i dont mind it at all

5,great aoo
5,really easy app to use
5,a very necessary app it has changed my life very well thanks for creating this app
1,latest update makes the widget not working
1,pay
1,the app sends too many notifications with annoying sound 
1,spam notifications when the to do list app auto updates it changes you settings for example causing spammy push notifications to pop up after i previously disabled notifications
1,it shut down after i tried to delete the preset characteristics and i lost everything right after i had just set everything up really frustrating
1,between tasks randomly failing without any input and undoing failed tasks creating fake duplicate tasks that cannot be deleted this app is too buggy to use for its intended purpose
1,seems like if i dont want to follow that junk on instagram i get  15 points instant uninstall
1,not very intuitive
1,it takes forever to download
1,i havent even opened this app and its already drained 30 percent of my battery wow waste of time and space
1,50 for a simple app no thanks
1,this is a really dumb app
1,this app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it very intrusive
1,novel but boring
1,is quite expensive
1,do not use this app if you need reminder notifications as they do not work even with app visable on screen let alone in the background app is pointless as does not stay alive in memory ignore reviews from users who have not tested the app you cannot set a notification after task start time so no way to confirm task completion widget does not update dev not interested in fixing complaints still exist since app creation many better apps to use instead this app does not work
1,tested on 4 android versions and devices 1 reminders only work with screen on  app in foreground app doesnt stay in memory 2 cant rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom 3 every notification perform button click annoying popup to confirm again cant be disabled 4 needs option for notification x minutes after task startend users need notification to inform what to start plus notification option to confirm its done at the task end time subscibe when fixed
1,doesnt work at all  as a developer myself its clear they dont know what theyre doing it should have every possible one but doesnt have any broadcast receivers or persistant notification to keep it alive from android oom freeing up memory which explains noone receiving notifications as seen in other reviews even when active notifications only received upon screen on despite battery optimization execlusion or doze completely disabled with root 5 stars and will subscripe once fixed
1,this app will create a review my tasks reminder when you launch it for the first time and by default will set the reminder to 5 hours before this can mean it will wake you up in the middle of the night with this reminder playing a loud notification sound it ignores the do not disturb mode of the phone it fails to show any visual notification so you will not know why your phone is making sounds in the middle of the night
1,too complicated ui design i just need a mindless tracker
1,unusable and badly designed due to being full of confirmation popups and bugs everything you do or dont do in and out of the app is followed by dozens of pointless popups which causes the app to constantly crash eg theres no need to confirm notification button presses once theres an option to disable all popups this rating can be updated to 5 stars and all of us can subscribe to premium lets see if the developer is interested in fixing and receiving more subscription revenue
1,too complicated wanted to use to strategize for my exam but it was to difficult to add a task
1,i like the app a lot bit i can not make the notifications sound to work i have enabled all notifications in setting  both the phone and the app but the only notification im getting is in the notification bar without the notification sound the app is quite useless
1,good app but does not respect do not disturb mode and keeps waking me up every night edit the issue is fixed giving the deserved 5 stars edit2 this is not fixed after all somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode but also manages to send notifications one hour after i fell asleep today it sounded around 4 am
1,i just cannot be notified please fix it so i could give 5 stars
1,i love all the recent changes you have made  especially the ability to undo things in the history could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks i would like to put mine in the order that i do them throughout the day and none of your sorting allows that thanks update its been 22 months since you said youd make drag and drop sorting an option i see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly dont promise what you wont deliver
1,dont offer to send notifications if you wont actually do it that was the whole reason why i thought this would help me and it didnt will be uninstalling
1,too much ads appeared out of no where
1,key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of 650 per month with the best deal simply shameless
1,ads too frequent didnt even finish setting up first days tasks
1,there are more effective and honest ways to turn a buck in the playstore crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is
1,could be good if basic features like icons werent locked behind a paid subscription update your calling themes an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one sorry but changing the background color to black which it should be in the first place isnt an advanced feature its about one line of code im a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality check out notion for a great example
1,crippled version without even a way to purchase outright edit ill be clearer many apps features are disabled but there is no way to just buy the app the only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service its just an app and a simple one at that its like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle bottom line its just a scummy business practice
1,only just discovered theres a bit of a sub didnt make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted
1,the app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list rpg  but theres a subscription you have to pay for literally completely ruins the purpose of the app
1,notifications dont work its a shame because i wanted to buy a subscription edit okay i already know whats going on the operating system of my smartphone is miui this apps notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off at the same time in the application settings i have the option no restrictions  battery saver doesnt restrict apps activity other applications similar to this one todo habits work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving
1,the app doesnt notify me when the task is ready to do please fix it or tell me what to do only when runs the app tasks work
1,rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
1,it seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use it looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback app crashes when using the calendar options this should not happend when using payed version of the app waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app
1,looks really complicated and its entirely prescription based i felt like i needed to take a class to learn it there are a lot of apps like this ill try another one
1,подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения
1,im sure the dev is well intended just no for me ux is terrible
1,super cool if youre a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars if youre a woman i hope you want to be a nun a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy or part of a couple not even kidding definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas
1,dont download after installation my calendar was full of commercials you won an iphone events with alarms
1,tasks dont update their descriptions until you quit and reopen cant set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription
1,read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription they said all major features are available for free no no they arent you cant access the calendar at all its an entire tab on the bottom of the app its pretty major in my book
1,app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press ok however you couldnt tap ok it just did nothing this happened every time gave up and uninstalled the app on a pixel 2 xl
1,the pop up adverts are so loud  terible 
1,decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy todo list is completely unacceptable take no for an answer
1,enough with the popup ads i dont mind if an app has ads but if im going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while im checking off my list im deleting your app and no im not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page if i have to pay to make the app decently usable you may as well require i pay for it to begin with
1,very bad experience
1,all right so to be clear this app is amazing and im really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it even though its such a great program it became unusable at day one it had bugs and limitations that hindered what i was attempting to accomplish problems such as inaccurate characteristics no quick access from rewards to inventory non removable default achievements inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics
1,annoying obstructive ads got fed up after one had a fake x button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it
1,couldnt figure out how to set reminder times wont do anything other then am
1,kicks me out of the game instantly not for me
1,че то вступительного туториала не достаточно чтобы понять что делать
1,notification not working
1,crashes on android 44 miui 9
1,buggy wont let me edit rewards no
1,"autofail only works if you go to each task thats not auto fail makes no 
sense might as well go back to life rpg that feature was the only reason 
i even tried this subscription model ridiculous why would i pay a monthly 
fee for some icons they are helpful icons  necessary mostly but thats 
just ridiculously expensive for some icons a one time fee is reasonable 
even if it was like 5 i wanted to like this app but this got in the way"
1,my entire plan was suddenly removed
1,this is worst task game in my life
1,the english used is very poor  thus if the developed cannot master simple rules of grammar why should i trust them with such sensitive subject matter  uninstalled
1,somehow bought its own subscription then i had trouble cancelling was enjoying til it stole my money i never saw any payment authorization window
1,uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature  done
1,one of the worst in the genre
1,this app is very very very sexist when you start the app up and go into the icon menu for the avatar of your hero character the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male   worse yet is that all of the ones intresting in thier design  or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male  the few female icons avalible  more than half not even on their own are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal   the developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny
1,i click undo but retain the xp no real theme or this app very bland needs character
2,way too complicated to use this app could be so much simpler the time ive wasted on it is time i could be doing tasks
2,the app isnt performing very well everything is laggy and when i press any button it takes 10 seconds to load i can still reccomend this app to any avid gamer whos looking for a way to actually do their tasks but its just too laggy
2,complicated interface adding a repeating task for specific days in the week is very tedious and buggy i added a task repeating mon wednesday friday and it gets added to my list for today saturday ui and ux could really use an overhaul
2,its not well organized i couldnt organize my schedule nicely i think it should be more simple and easy also reminder didnt work and i dont know why
2,auto fail doesnt work properly subtasks dont work properly for repeated goals
2,very useful but completely loses its value when you dont get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others other times you dont even get any i mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you dont even get the reminder please fix this problem
2,nice idea for an app but dont like the fact that you cant customize the hero to be a woman also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it edit  but there are no female icons
2,a lot of work was put into this i love the idea of it i just got this and i was looking through the app seeing what i can do i love the features and what you can do you can use the app without buying stuff but what your selling it for is crazy 46 for one time purchase is a bit much for a task reminder or 1020 for half or full year i love the app i would pay for it if payment is 249 one time purchase or 1299 for one time purchase instead of a 6 months
2,i had the same problem where i started this app in the middle of intense projects and moving so i fell a couple days behind unfortunately skipping dozens of tasks was too time consuming and i dont like leaving a bunch overdue i know partly its my impatience so i have two stars the other is it just isnt for me
2,seemed like a great idea could not for the life of me figure it out
2,calendar is a premium feature making this pointless without a subscription
2,good idea implementation to be revised the management of the task is not clear the dates are showed in a confusing way again the concept is good but the user interface has to be improved and updated
2,ok concept but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of ai with suggestions for every parameter and sync between different devices to get the basic functionality into usable state
2,when i checklist todays note automatically overdues note checked too whats wrong
2,so cool but insanely expensive also wasnt clear how to get started even with the manual i have no reading comprehension issues there is just no getting started section or similar then i saw the fees 50 wow that is high i hate when people gripe that theyre asked to pay for apps  am a big fan of supporting developers but 50 is nuts this isnt a service one subscribes to ex spotify and 50 is nuts to purchase an app not trying to be mean  am fine paying but 50 is way high
2,a chore to figure out
2,notifiction is not working properly when i set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line app doesnot send me task notification about its deadline not working
2,i had to put in all the info
2,one of the most expensive apps i have ever seen or tried everything costs money subscription check paid themes check i mean i spent a fortune on apps and i am in favor of continuous support but still losing my lifetime savings is just not okay reminds me of the app newton mail where they went from free to oh my god this is expensive imo users would sub way more if the options were affordable sorry for 25 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices i cant say that its an ok app
2,confusing over complicated and bland looking the fact that i had to go delete the habits that it had already chosen for me made it worse
2,i try to set tasks for only specific days of the week but it does not work after i complete the task thats it its done forever doesnt repeat since most of my tasks need this feature to workthe app really isnt good for me
2,i was going to give 4 stars but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to google play if you said five stars so i lowered it to 2 stars
2,i started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times so just removed them and no longer use biggest feature i would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the today option for the task list widget sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when i can complete all my tasks the next day the list doesnt refresh still says all tasks are done
2,i liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them
2,do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing subscriptions for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app like we used to see then this is the app for you add one more debit to your bank account they hope youll forget about and statistically speaking  you will for a stagnant app youll forget about in a week
2,too complicated i spent a half hour looking at the guide trying to figure it out created new characteristics and tasks but on the home page theres no dropdown to choose a task when i saw id have to create one every time i decided to uninstall suggestion create tutorial no one has time for the long guide if we did we wouldnt need a productivity app
2,it is complicated
2,spending 10 once or 5year for a subscription would make sense to me but paying 15year to use a todo list when discounted is really excessive this is a great tool  actually i love it but i find it ridiculous to pay so much just to temporarily unlock basic features like a calendar edit since writing the above review ive found cheaperfree alternatives the one im using is called treat yourself its free and doesnt look great but it serves my needs just right and i love it
2,price is very high for indian users we dont get 110 of what a us citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices dont make a sense
2,is a pretty good app but its got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things ive done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day
2,quite good one but i prefer single purchase option but seriously i like the statistics well i saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup
2,annoying backup system ive had installed this app and logged in with google account once i also tried some of the apps features but i uninstalled again because of reasons after some times i decided to install it again so i made my tasks and the others without logging in first because i forgot then when i logged in with my google account after that it replace my current data with the older one without warning now all my newly created more complete data is all gone
2,cool idea but it keeps crashing when you try to add subtasks
2,im not interested in subscriptions one time fee would be fine by me
2,kind of ha are to get the hang of maybe im just stupid idk but i never did figure it out
2,convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking stats cant be reset all the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled its also weird how done cant be hidden
2,doesnt do what i need it to do with setting recurring alarms such as every 3 hours forever it just says how many times do you want this to repeat but doesnt let you choose hourly just daily weekly etc
2,user interface is so tough specially for a new person even there is no guide that how to use on front there r those things which r not useful for a working person like those xp and all dont know how to find week date or tym for an alert not impressive
2,repeats tick nowhowever i encountered another problem theres no way to restore purchases meaning if you subscribe and than resetwipe the app or your phone you cant use the subscription features anymore and to get it back you have to completely resubscribe
2,the ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous charge a single flat rate  if the style does change to flat ratead free ill gladly change my review
2,i really like the application so far great interface and feature set id really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set i think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too even better if the group can collapse it would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that overall a great application i hope you continue working on this application  edit the app is still decent but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating
2,so you reskinned liferpg whats different here
2,by default before the current update was rolled out tasks were set to the date today now they are being set to feb 1 3880 how weird
2,this app is an excellent idea if only it worked i have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing its a shame as it has a lot of potential
2,refreshing tasks is a nightmare
2,i really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone one second they were fine then when i connect to the internet its back at lvl 0 with the johnny avatar  it seemed that there was no way to get my data back dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do i feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that i dont even know what caused it
2,not a movable app
2,this is not an rpg this is a goal tracker with an avatar ffs so useless
2,needs a dark mode
3,almost perfect i only wish it had more to do with the game aspect its basically a todo list or planner sure it gives you some gold and experience points based on your completed tasks but they amount to nothing as there is nothing to do with either once collected no builtin items to purchase no character creation or customisation disappointing that being said the tasks are easy to create and customise i feel more organised than usual so thanks i guess
3,i really like the depth of this tracker including skills titles really more of an elder scrolls feel and personally seeing myself being lacking in certain skills would motivate me to add more tasks that would improve those i was all set to subscribe and spend too many hours customizing the experience curve all of the tasks and their various skills and really dig into the advanced features but then i hit the deal breaker there is no web interface for this app everything has to be set up on your phone i love having notifications and a checklist on my phone to keep up with repeating tasks habits and todos on the go but im looking for an app to add dozens of things to initially and continue adding and modifying as time goes on but to have to do that on my note 20 is just something im not on board with i need to be able to pull it up on my computer as im working to check things off or see my next scheduled task by picking up my phone being the only way to check what i need to do it sets me up for failure because my phone is a distraction im trying to use less while working and since im working from home now theres no accountability so that temptation to check my facebook notifications is strong if there was a way to open this on a browser and not through some janky android emulator or using my chromebook because i dont use that for work then id already be neck deep in it but sadly im stuck using an app that replaces the reward of tracking real life stat progression with digital outfits for your avatar something i couldnt care less about please get a browser interface going
3,i tried to set task to only do wednesday and friday and it wouldent work so i uninstaled apart from that its a good app
3,not for me i was hoping for something with an alarm doesnt help if i dont get a reminder looks interesting though
3,i gave this 3 stars i do like this app and it has lots of potential but i think in execution a few different arrangements would make it more useful for example if the default mode was to instantiate a particular task from a class of universal tasks it would be easier and simpler than managing a list of variables under which tasks are contained characteristics could have subcharacteristics as well items could have more welldefined powers like delegating the task but not completing it
3,this app is incredibly unintuitive attempting to create an event with specific start and end dates is overcomplicated i still cant get the specific dates option to function properly in the calendar the app freezes if you delete the preset characteristics this should not have left beta with so many duplication errors please fix this i regret paying for this app edit additionally deleting an occurrence of a reoccurring task only ones previous entries in its place
3,działa ale zwykła aplikacja habits naprawdę wystarczy
3,application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing  duplicate task feature doesnt duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated tasks so you cannot create a template task which could be used to create other similar deep task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures this is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently without this i will be forced to look at less
3,the app crashes when there are less than 2 characteristics of the hero i like customizing so at first i deleted all presets to replace them with my own but if i delete all characteristics and then try to add 1 new characteristic the app crashes and the only way to get it to work again is to clear all the data and start the app from scratch
3,this seems like a great app but if you fall off the wagon or take a long vacation with dozens of daily tasks then theres no realistic way to recover because you have to dismiss potentially thousands of passfails until you can get a list of just current and relevant tasks remaining for today multiselect helps but still no good after a summer break or older user with a 12 tasks triggering daily for a year  4380 to dismiss by tapping each one could solve with a select all feature
3,starting tasks are not useful for me and creating my own task feels like it requires a degree not at all intuitive i love the idea of it but it feels too complicated and id have to spend more time setting it up then actually using it
3,guys i really love this app and feature ambkt confused of putting repeated reminder as am use to it and i love that reminder alarm to make me awake all the time i miss something i cant find that or else please help me guiding for thatand also upload more videos on youtube for new users to understand as you guys have hardly any video
3,after the last update it wont let me check off my tasks without inapp purchasing when it used to be free
3,i dont know how useful this will be yet but i should point out that subscribing to your instagram shouldnt be an infinitely repeatable task xd
3,i really enjoyed the concept used it for about a year and paid what ultimately stopped me from using it is it is not user friendly and glitched constantly it wouldnt keep my settings even though i changed the default or populate tasks on my widget format for setting up recurring events is hard to navigate and it kept duplicating and deleting tasks when using desktop version basically an awesome concept performed poorly i think if more resources were put in to this app it would be epic
3,seems like a really awesome app but blocks stuff behind a subscription or a buy all one time payment would rather pay piece meal it also has ads in the free version that you cant get rid of without the sub or 50 buy all
3,fine for daily grind tasks but a hassle for spontaneous tasks not for those who lack patience like the design tho 
3,this app is pretty cool and im trying to get used to be but geez its so difficult to just create the list of repeatable tasks i want to have theres a today tomorrow important section and depending on how you choose to set up your tasks they might not be on any list its super confusing and aggrivating
3,the presentation is slick highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to just do one more thing before bed time liking it it would have been an easy 5 star if not for the widgets unfortunately they do not continue the established level of customizability especially rescaling elements of the ui of all tasks to fit it into a smaller screen is missing further there is a bug that all tasks are done after clicking away two tasks oxygen os 1033
3,a lot of bugs low range of choose and opportunities
3,too difficult
3,this could have been the one but i cant take pictures
3,i really wish this had a website setting this up so far has been a pain in the butt i get maybe they dont allow selecting multiple tasks to prevent cheating or something but it really is tedious doing the same thing over and over again to 30 habits trying to push through it though well see
3,im sure some of what i experienced could be addressed but the little things kept piling up certain things are on autofail but history shows no failures items that failedpassed the day before arent showing up in history for hours marked something as done but it alerted me to address it an hour later multiple times got notices to perform tasks that werent scheduled for that day plus others loved this app but finally gave it up
3,why cant i set a task to be done 3 times a week anyday during the week most of my tasks are like that update okay ill try that thanks
3,too much lag  freezing
3,nice idea with a few issues some tasks never seem to go away whether i say i did them or fail or skip or try to edit they always stay there for the same day also if i miss one day it takes forever going through each missed task and either skipping or failing or deleting or whatever and like i said sometimes that doesnt work fix these issues and i could really get behind using this app
3,very user unfriendly with hardly any explanation regarding what the buttons do or the stats mean trying to edit tasks for each day will only let me invent new tasks not pick from a list utterly confusing could have been so much easier
3,pretty fun idea but the widget needs improvement i always have to insert a new task or refresh the widget in order to see my task
3,same review as rpg gamify
3,good app and i like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in my problem with the app is that its too overwhelming too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain its too much as constructive that can actually be appliedplease make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done otherwise good job on this app its well made
3,i like the idea how it shows my skills but i hate it when it organize the tasks in orders it sets up automatically wherever it wants manual task organizer should be available
3,this is a rereview this could be the best habit tracker goal setter and task manager with some really great features like nested lists and smartauto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup just dont confuse the game in rpg for any actual gameplay but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system that deserves recognition allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the users daily life however do it now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups after a solid month of use building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks and setting up several habit based routines the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next while autogrouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared once again losing the important ones in the clutter user defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series with no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver 2230 there is no task sharing there is also no designated pcmaclinux front end for desktop syncing finally its expensive as apps go a one off of 75 will get the full version or about 250 a month paid yearly which removes ads and gives calendar access original review a good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy it would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader
3,i used to use habitica and i must say this is a great step up id like to see more social features such as sharing tasks  only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off but only giving that person the experience and gold otherwise the price for subscription is too steep thus resulting in a subperfect score i could easily justify 099month or eternal subscription for 15 if that price could be met as well as fine tuning this would be easily worth 5 stars
3,as someone who has adhd and deals with executive dysfunction this is a very useful app there are a lot of paywalls though
3,was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day everyday duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way but it clutters up the task list like 8 lines so im reminded to drink 8 glasses of water and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list both within and outside of the main task i thought the repeat every 1 day 8 times custom setting might work but its a different function
3,i like that this app notifies you for tasks but it should respect android systems do not disturb i shouldnt be reminded when i sleeping and i explicitly turn off notifications no other app i have notifies me in do not disturb mode
3,ive just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks it really looks nice and really structured so far my only surprise is that theres no female icon for the person only nuns or dancers but not a simple female icon that doesnt do anything  just stands hello is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere
3,i am in love with this app so far i wish there was an ios version available to connect with my friends though i would recommend this to everyone otherwise 3 stars for now due to limited availability
3,this app should be made to work around certain schedules for example people who work the third shift graveyard shift have a completely different schedule than say a person who works a 9573311 etc im certain this adjustment would be greatly appreciated
3,the app is great for the most part i just wish that the notification option for tasks would actually alert me no alarm or even a popup message i got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues but its not gonna be of any help if i cant even remember i have the app please fix the alarm notification system
3,ads were annoying and it took a lot of steps to set up tasks however it was nifty to use and definitely allowed a lot of control due to the aforementioned steps
3,app itself is nice but needs a lot of polish right now its kind of a bugfest
3,this app could be five stars to me what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do theres a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if i did not do them the day before or not click them they just show up there if i delete a task from the calendar on accident what do i do the calendar should be completely removed cuz its worthless i think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row
3,its a good starti currently have a 1 month subscription needs more habit type features needs to track  display and keep a record of current and longest streaks repeat option needs much more options like 1 a way to track a task thats done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day 2 repeat week should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days 3 achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days
3,might be good but it doesnt have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it
3,app crashing a lot do look into it and solve the problem asap
3,a very good but incomplete idea there is no way to track time spent on certain habits there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour besides the statistics are super limited and basic
3,very motivational but whats with the subscription fee fifteen dollars a year
3,the fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use or rather this will work if user can just define the task quest easily or maybe we can import by purchasing some set of quests for me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered would be use it furthere more if not too complicated
3,it would be great if the notifications actually works i dont get notified by any task i put in at all
3,ok but doesnt feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall
3,i went from touching the app once a day to once a week over the span of about 2 months would be better if notifications were functional could be enabled i like the concept of being a hero though i just always fail all my daily set tasks repeatedly back to level 0 hahaha  i stick to my sticky notes app with reminders that ive been using for years edit 111019 i see notifications on appear on my phone now thank you
3,setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall its good the notifications arent working on my phone and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day id like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird give me a notification 12 hours before the whole point of me getting a todo list app was to have not only a list but reminders so until the notifications work ill have to resort to a different app
3,asks for a subscription to get all the features id pay a one time fee only guess you dont want my money bad enough edit yes i know which is why you got a negative review i like your app i dont like paying subs i raised u to 3 stars for taking this so well all to often devs get all butt hurt add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if its 20 dollars and ill buy it or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least cheers do this than 5 stars
3,i wanted to buy the app but the subscription feature turned me down i wish there was a one time purchase option to unlock essential things like calendar unlimited inventory etc and the subscription for themes sounds and other cosmetic stuffs
3,really amazing but there are popup adverts if youre not a member and for someone like me thats quite a few adverts daily very annoying but everything else is perfect fyi the designers have to eat so im not mad but god damn thats annoying would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you dont have to do it later just an idea id be up for
3,it would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest and even recommend books etc also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow for example read book requires a picture of a book with your face or run requires a tracking through the gps to actually verify yoy ran in this way it can even be competitive
3,good experience nice concept sad that its not completely free for a todo list and completely frustrating that it keeps crashing everytime i want to edit my level and changing my avatar it went brainfarted when it got overwhelmed by a long list of levels starting from 50
3,a decent app for its intents and purposes but i struggle to stay invested its visually good great icons and colours also has a nice selection of skills my biggest issue is the navigation i cant immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks actually marking something as done especially subtasks is a challenge  mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier
3,reminder doesnt work
3,there could be any difference between gold that we earn if my rewards are cheat meal and netflix episode and tasks are run 10 km and read a book it shouldnt be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book
3,it crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment why not just make it 5 lifetime seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar
3,very interesting concept but its extremely time consuming to setup and add all the content you need also being able to edit everything and choose the rewards freely kinda looses its purpose i understand some people might like the feature but i personally do not overall great app if you have the time to set it up and get familiar with it
3,overall a really good app well thought however i would personally spend some time on the interfaceinteractions it became too many steps for my preferences realizing i needed to change a bunch of tasks i had to pick a task bottom right to edit then tap below description untick termless select date click ok top right another ok top right thats too much i suggest adding swiping options to the task look at nine email as an example but overall good might return one day 
3,everything requires you to pay money might as well make it a paid game instead of deceiving people for a free app
3,awesome idea five plus in advance although turns out there are more appealing apps interface wise but non the less it is all about insides not the outside
3,i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested to dos cuz i can never think of things to do
3,the app is great but after using awhile it start to lag
3,too much paid only
3,the app itself is a wonderful idea but the interface and functions need a lot of work in my opinion it took me so long to figure out how to set up a habit and i still dont understand how to use a task groups or steps i gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one anyway i will definitely retry after an update 
3,i really like this app makes life more fun foy adhd brain but sound making ads are a real pain im okay with the ads in general they dont pop up often enough to be annoying but can we get rid of the ones that make sound so i can stop embarrassing myself in a quiet class room after checking off an assignment
3,i love the idea of it but currently its far too complicated for me to use id love it very much if all the setting rewards and gained skills was a little easier to do
3,its not bad but it seems greedy like why do i have to pay to unlock individual color themes if im paying a monthly subscription also liferpg was so much better than this more icons to choose from and they were free if youre going to make an app that copies all the ideas from liferpg at least make it better why cant i make an accomplishment like learned blank piece of music without having to tie it to accomplishing a certain number of tasks or reaching a certain level
3,this app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity
3,it actually is a good app but it wont do the one other thing i need it to do which is notify me of a task i set one day it does and the others it doesnt i have reset my phone settings several times because of this looked it up and still no results
3,i really like the app but i would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in liferpg also if there was a quicker way to edit like in life rpg that would be great i would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys but right now liferpg is more practical and theyll get my money until you catch up love the decreasing skills btw 
3,its ok notifications dont work very often
3,needs fixes like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit looks like the developers dont use it themselves
3,with discipline training apps the market bet is on already diligent people to buy your app with such a small margin of customers you cannot expect success from limiting customization options to microtransactions let alone subscriptions otherwise the app was decent good work credit where credit is due
3,suggestion can tasks take things from the inventory maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task
3,dont like it very much but i think its just not for me its very complex and deep with tasks and such i could even set the percentage of fear for a task what so i didnt get very far before i just said forget it my life is too busy for such complexity
3,"youre good guys your efforts are admirable please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support rtl"
3,"uhm theres a little bug that i encountered i cannot disable the skill 
decay  pls fix ill give 5 stars"
3,"loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so im not using it anymore ill be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isnt present next time 
"
3,i really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks but a while ago whenever i would open the app it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if i tapped anything the rest of my phone still works fine doesnt freeze while this happens is there anything i can do to fix this i would love to continue using this app thank you and i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling edit clearing did solve the problem for now too bad i had to give up all the progress i made but thank you anyway at least i can use the app again
3,it ok gets boring after a while
3,it was really good for helping me to get motivated for a few days but when i shut my phone off the notifications stop coming until i open the app again and check off something
3,i thought it was a really good app until today it started to crush and i couldnt do anything to backup i lost all of my options todo lists  achievements dont know what should i do really disappointed auto backup should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup filesnot dropbox
3,a intenção é boa mas a interface é bastante confusa  the intention is good but the interface is too confusing
3,it is a good application it is very useful it is just okay
3,great app needs  a few things like task fail without consequences option mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase not every one has everything connected to internet all the time
3,its such a spectacular idea but i had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a daytoday basis
3,this is ok  but it required bunch of upgrade and some new features  will keep it but wait till is it perfect
3,good but not ok
3,everything about this app is perfect except for the widget support the widget doesnt update with the new tasks i make in the app and i wish i could mark tasks as complete right from the widget i would also like to be able to make multiple notifications for one task or set one task to repeat multiple times a day i also wish the notification for the mission would show up every time great start
3,are there any guides out there
3,hey guys this is good idea however i have a feedback for you several times i accidentally was clicking task more than once so i was increasing my level i didnt found related settings i think you should make task clickable checkable do you get me only once per day and highlight the finished tasks this features will prevent accidental checking therefore increasing level incorrectly could you explain me how to use such features if you already have them
3,its a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time
3,the concept is good but why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though i have turned the notification on this is very bad
3,the app is good but a faq would be appreciated for example i cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks
3,this is unforgivably close to perfect why no timer so many tasks are longterm and need to be chipped away at bit by bit you could have it where once a task was selected the timer would start and you would earn a certain amount of experience and coin for every x amount of minutes completed  as it is i have two pair this app with a different promodo app
3,but then it started locking up everytime i tried to load it  ved it until then
3,i cant be the only one multitasking therefore i dont have time to figure out a basic program i put in a picture and it was so tiny i put in my tasks yet some are timeless some are daily and there was powerlifting im physically crippled
3,my settings kept on changing ever time i reopen the app for example fear is set to zero when i open the app again fear is set to 80 why please fix this its getting tiresome to redo the settings over and over
3,its almost what i was looking for apart from is there a way to set how much xp is required to advance in level and how much xp completing a task will give you eg i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41 i will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc  otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100
3,but cant really test this out since im tied with habitica  oh yeah i personally dont like the avatars though itd be nice if to upload your own avatar oh just saw other people suggest the same lol
4,it really helps with getting things done receiving xp gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do i like that  on the contrary to other apps  it is actually useful without having to get the premium version though the premium version is a nice addition suggestion some rewards could already be existent so you dont have to come up with them yourself i personally dont have many ideas for coming up with rewards and dont know what gold price would be appropriate
4,i need help from dev one of my favorite apps of all time combines scheduling and rpg gaming in one not 5 stars because i bought premium but when i logged into my kindle premium status didnt show up neither did my other data from my phone please help devs
4,nice app with lot of options like the reward system developper look active as i read the reviews and take comment into consideration what is fear doing in the task don t really understand  ui could get some work not possible to have reminder on ad vitam eternam task don t know if possible to have multiple reminder for the same task but would be usefull maybe a better tutorial don t like wall of text for tutorial something more interactive would be nice would love to have reward separated per group for example i am eating healty all week long i can have a burger i am stopping smoking  do sport i can have a new phone what would motivated me is a picture of my reward that get slowly fullfilled as i get closer to my goal very expensive app
4,i normally dont leave reviews but i think this app is great i love the chart wheel thing i think it would be cool to set the characteristics andor skills chart week thing as an option for widget on the phone screen however its been more than a week now since i sent an email to support and i havent received any help back concerning my account please get back to me as soon as possible also i will leave a more nice detailed review in the future once i get into using it more 
4,just staryed using it theres a pretty massive learning curve especially when it comes to the complete customization of your character characteristics skills and in general finding the flow that works for you but so far its been really helpful and an enjoyable experience
4,so far just setting it up is very easyfor me the gaming aspect of it is very appealing for the adhd side of me i wish i could get the full version but that will have to wait until i get a job thank you so much for creating this app
4,was really good but i think itd be even better if it had a widget that could just take up a whole screen and mark complete on tasks from there
4,my favourite to do app but the price of subscription is hilarious
4,ivery good app i would recommend it
4,i like alot about this app but really want to add one thing to make it round out my gamify experience skill tree i would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge some skills may need levels to unlock from other skills or need a basis in 2 skills to be usable it really would make this app a huge step above any other gasification app
4,its a pretty good app it makes me want to do tasks unlike other apps
4,i absolutely love the app ive had it for a short time but i know ill love it this app helps me keep my day organised and be productive in a fun way the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is simple so much more room for work and improvement in all directions keep up the great work my personal request is a bit of work on the inventory system as it would be great to keep track of that too the need for quest rewards for items is a bit wonky but my only complaint so far
4,pretty decent but it ignores my default repeat value and honestly the interface for setting a reminder datetime when creating a new task is clunky and needs to be smoother
4,im loving it so far is there any way to switch out the icons with some on the file system
4,how i add multiple user profile
4,it crashes when you complete a task
4,for me is one of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning
4,really a fun and somewhat complex habit tracker to have recommendation  you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills i made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures maybe like dice roll mechanics would be fun to see your skill in use cos just building them up isnt enough good job add this quest system and its a complete app also app generated loot too
4,regarding the last review i noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the emptied list glitch happening more often unrelated but i really love the idea of the new batch action feature just wondering why i cant use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task i expected that to be the point but only batch delete and batch skip are available batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use which is that failing takes like 3 taps
4,i love this app its helped me quite a bit i would love to provide 5 stars but im having issues with no notifications even though i have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when i finish a task i really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app ive ever used
4,allows me take some of the real life out my responsibilities
4,really really im struggling a little bit with some details but im loving so far
4,some integrated examples would be nice also an inventory of items to help pick rewards but i have no income so i have to miss out on the good stuff
4,so far so good trying to get in to it
4,tasks in all tasks group is frequently disappearing  reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great
4,love the way this app is helping me its great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system 4 stars only because of apps free theme
4,perfect for me takes some serious investment to set up proberly but absolutely worth it however the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp further more when i use a task that gives me 100 exp my herolevel gets stuck at 9025 and doesnt update anymore if these minor bugs are fixed i will provide the 5th star
4,i love this app i only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts
4,this app is almost everything i want i just wish there was more of an rpg element i played habitica and it didnt quite scratch that itch either maybe something like small quests that utilize text and dicerolls that can be improved based on your level in different categories id enjoy the hell out of that and would happily pay for expansions additional questsstories etc
4,really awesome app i think the best one the only it lacks web version since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits with web version it would be much easier
4,it seems good but there is no way for me to increase the art category music and drawing are not the only forms of art please change this maybe change art to crearivity but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it also arent erudition and learning really the same thing my conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work
4,strong fallout skyrim feel but full buy price is 45 even those games price are lower on sale and i bought them on sale other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars and the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background i dont sub apps i buy themsub is for something like netflix and spotify
4,add check system count system  how many times and timer  count down and count up then no need to use other appstnx
4,this app is very good for keeping on task and everything is totally customizable one thing i would improve is the simplisity of it right now its a bit too much to handle and if there was an easier way to do things it would make this app even greater
4,i have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far definitely worth a subscription for the full experience shared it with friends but unfortunately its only available on android one major issue though is i cant select the quantity to use for consumables if you decided to put in 1000 credits in there youll have to click 3000 times to use it takes the fun out of it also wish it had a web page version like habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their os
4,ill give it five stars when the widget stops resetting to nothing after i alter things within the app i have to delete it off of my screen and put it back on in order for it to update
4,i love this app and use it on my android phone now i have an ipad and cannot find this app for it is there an ios version available
4,the popup after u conclude a task is very exhaustive if u take off these the app would be perfect and also if u stay a day without doing the tasks the app goes crazy and stop placing the tasks correct
4,great idea really creative and love thr preset activities that offer guidance
4,in primo luogo adoro voglio dire una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività lezioni cose così altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme ma hem io non ho idea di come si faccia help me please cosa numero tre ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e magari fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami o campagne composte di varie sessioni
4,slightly intuitive should have a tutorial other than that loving it since i love rpgs
4,app has improved a lot since initial launch and its still my goto for my daily tasks still hoping for more social features in the future also there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use i think its still related to the amount of tasks i have i have a very busy schedule and it causes my phone to overheat keep up the good work
4,i absolutely love this app i am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks i tried similar apps and theyre not quite as good tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options so why not 5 stars well there are some issues but please take them as constructive criticism 1 it is not respecting the silence mode 2 steep learning curve worth it though 3 auto failing task with subtask is not working i will promptly give 5 starts when 1 is fixed
4,personally taking the time to translate my every task into rpg format is tedious pretty time consuming in terms of customization its more like an rpg maker but todo style its not what im looking for but given the developers perspective its excellent for what its worth flexible extremely customizable and full of possibilities suggestion allowing to download other users formats theyve already taken the time to create
4,great but have some issues with the tasks list widget no way i can complete a task on it without its disappearing
4,great creative idea that does help keep me on track ive also used it to start new good habits
4,its a good app looks polished and nice only problem i have is i have some tasks that repeat themselves even after i complete them ive editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks
4,good app minus a star as you cant manually sort task lists with your finger and change their priority that way
4,ive really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful although to me the app seems like its not fully finished i wish the stats you were building actually did something in game the money also seems kind of pointless i can buy items that i create but they just adjust your stats which i could easily accomplish through tasks
4,it is a lot better than the other apps out an 8 or 16bit ui makeover would be dope the pixel look and feel always nostalgic
4,havent used it much but so far i enjoy the idea i would like to suggest adding a notification every so often option for example im wanting to do 12 pushups every hour every day 10 hours a day
4,a bit underrated its a fun way to get things done kind of like having a video game character it does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores homework etc done 
4,its a great app and very useful but i would like for it to add an options delete after completion this means it would repeat until you hit the check button
4,app has definitely improved since my last review more social features would be really cool i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off i have noticed recent stability issues when im on the app for a prolonged period not sure if its related to the amount of tasks i have as i use this app for basically all my tasks including birthdays the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile otherwise this is still my goto 4 stars again
4,this is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life ive had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks but this may be a device issue im not sure
4,works as expected but i would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise
4,it been running kind of slow when youre making new tasks
4,add negative habits which when done decrease coin xp etc
4,nice app bug with achievement exp gained it only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg 144exp25exp  why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it
4,тарас это крутая идея и хорошая реализация доставляет кайф возможность разбивать дэйлики на подпункты будет чётко если добавишь возможность автозавершения после выполнения всех пунктов система ачивок вполне юзабельно но нужно устанавливать ачивки на habit generate  по типу 30 дней без перерыва и при желании по возрастающей 3 месяца и т д nexus 5x lineages os 151 не работают reminders не готов брать подписку но если добавишь отдельный платный контент иконки или журнал квестов  куплю
4,its helping me the way i think
4,неплохое приложение для поднятия своей дисциплины в игровой форме перейдем к минусам  дорого за полную версию серьёзно 3400 рублей за полную версию навсегда  это очень дорого мне кажется что автор случайно дописал лишний ноль 340  ладно 3400  дрого  не всё доступно без полной версии это немного относится к первому минусу теперь плюсы  повышение дисциплины в игровой форме например если быть чесным и выставлять адекватные награды то всё очень классно
4,i am liking it the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh especially for the full buy out at 50 dollars a suggestion id like to see two categories under the skills one that says increasing and one that says decreasing i am trying to set up a daily grind negative skill that decreases will power and motivation while increasing submission and routine ive noticed the dev team is really good at responding so i am hopeful for a response thanks
4,i really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 247
4,its helpful but its also annoying edit i didnt make it clear enough its annoying to realize how much im failing lol anyway the app is pretty good im just overly sensitive and self criritcal
4,homescreen widget would be nice with more display option such as the progress bar etc
4,good app lots of customization but i have noticed an issue with repeating subtasks if a subtask is set to repeat it wont complete the main task seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat
4,i like this app but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning when just checking the time i dont want to be woken up even more i wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once
4,i really like the app im having an issue though where the widget doesnt populate when a new day starts i have to delete it and readd it or restart my phone
4,i think its a great app and a lot of fun i had some trouble figuring things out at first but everything works the only complaint i would have is the cost it would be nice to have some of the features but they are too expensive
4,the app is allready great the amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work the sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow as the app is rpg themed those elements could be further enhanced imo i think a customisable character would be fun more options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at this way you really build something with the effort youve put in for the games keep up the good work
4,this app is great i love the idea of turning my daily life like an rpg game but i have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing so can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed been trying my hardest to do this on your app even finished reading the user guide but it still wouldnt work
4,i really like it i think its a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits only thing i wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits
4,the app is good and in general highly customizable but it has one flaw it uses days 24 hours periods as a basic unit of measure but it doesnt let you change the default starting hour midnight this is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night i would rate it as a 5 stars app if i could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly
4,turn life into a game create your own tasks and assign value to them pretty cool eh
4,nice will be better if app has got inhabit counter for example count of pushups or exercise i need it but app is very nice i will be recommend it
4,it is a cool app but the calendar feature required to be bought that should be informed to the users before installation in addition it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time and skills can decrease characteristics
4,great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized one thing they should add is overall goals and tasks leading to those goals
4,interesting concept still getting used to the functionality but this app is an effective way to gamify your todo and task lists before do it now rpg i had a list of chores now i have a questlist instead time to go unlock some achievements
4,this app is so robust i love it however i would love a quick add button in the notifications
4,i just started but really like it so far competes directly with habitica but less of the nonsense costumes its hard at first to sort characteristics skills and tasks you are essentially your own game dev but on paper i recently sorted out what i want to improve skills and what is stopping me characteristics tasks will follow soon after im really hopeful about this setup i love the design and i never do this but i might actually pay for a subscription  if all goes well
4,perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist it has profound customization ability the reward system is more complex than competitors for someone with significant attention issues this has really helped me to feel invested subtasks and autofails are great features would be 5 stars if developers 1 allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2 made tutorialvideos full functionality will be a learning curve for many
4,looking forward to a better uiux will keep using it
4,just after i looked at the interface i knew it was what i was searching not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books for anyone who think in terms of goals and obviously who love rpgs its totally free though
4,its a good app for everyday tasks it takes time to customize it and its normal because its an rpg type however i think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless you can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want this bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah
4,complete a tip the task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability
4,i would love to do a onelife time purchase for this app too bad i hate subscription based so sorry id rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app
4,i was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress and this does it but it is missing one to me basic feature  the tasks dont have a start time or duration period there is only a deadline it doesnt allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time is this feature available in the premium version at least another missing feature is the location setting at least at a homeworkoutdoors level any plans to incorporate the features
4,the app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks
4,it keeps reminding me even after the task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times i should be notified but overall nice app
4,treating activities like a game gives me a sense of accomplishment when i successfully finish my duties and earn xp
4,awesome app to keep your life on track would 5 star but app crashes every time i try and add a custoum sound edit thank you will try again after the next update
4,ive been using this app for some weeks now there are still some features that i dont understand and theres just so much available for customisation that its overwhelming but once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted this app has been so fun and useful most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing this one isnt it has helped me prioritize whats important to me while letting me roleplay i like it a lot
4,pretty easy to use and reliable still trying to figure out the ins and outs but its been fairly easy to pick up
4,the apps are functioning well and recommended trying for rpg theme if you love rpg but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate
4,very interesting application just to complicated for me
4,pros its fun lots of customisation all basic functionality are free inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list cons first time setup are quite challenging literally create your own system icons  themes are limited minor inconvenience i was using liferpg which seems abandoned now so it helps with the learning curve i see devs made lots improvement here recommended
4,hello this app is great but i have a suggestion with the inventory items please make it so you can give them attribites such as 10 xp gain or 10 gold gain or just 10 xp for a specific skill
4,this app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned liferpg app and from a bit of digging so far im impressed some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but its a relatively low price and helps support the devs so ill probably bite on that once ive set up everything and used the app a bit one suggestion id have is to implement geotagged triggers for events  like bringing up a reminder when im near the gym or store
4,jibj
4,it would be nice if there are preset goals or task to choose from  while the app allow for a high level of customization its too much hassle to set it all up properly not to mention balancing the reward from each task
4,its one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable
4,definetly a 4 star good app good concepts some bugs not really pulling me in thou i forgot about it which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it so 4 stars
4,fun and productive
4,i bought the full version its a fun app to challenge yourself i would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon which seem to be missing that would be useful for example if you want to write a book it would be nice to have a bookicon or pen icon or pencil icon update i seem them now thanks for responding and letting me know looks like i needed to scroll farther down to see them 
4,easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day
4,crashes when i customize my hero status
4,i downloaded this game in the hopes that the format would help me with my procrastination and can i just say its exceeded my expectations its so good  i ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that its great highly recommend if you like me like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks
4,its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother or a way to access it on a computer or browser
4,its a lot of fun good personalization i have to make time to explore the app called more fully i think a tutorial would be amazing and predeveloped lists that could be tweaked
4,fantastic app but 4 stars every part has been a comfortable experience for me until i started trying to use it across devices i took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when i signed into my account for the app all the tasks i had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device it was partially my fault for the careless order that i signed in on the devices but perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if i wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again that said every other function provided is great and i would recommend
4,new user and im impressed a lot of neat features ive been looking for in apps like this its obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign if i have an immediate suggestion itd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristicsskills for example to add things like personality lifestyle or however we want to organize our skillset categories so those 2 sections arent cluttered a search option for icons too maybe keep it up
4,life changing app with a great concept but still needs some work
4,liking it a lot so far but i dont get it doesnt give a warning ring before tasks i put in thats kind of the main thing i need it for  to remind me of tasks i had previously put in
4,fun and easy to use creative and helpful way to track tasks and habits
4,one thing the widget sometimes doesnt update the today list and about the to do list i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow because when all tasks show cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again  maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today thank you hope this app improve
4,i cant sign in neither with my google account nor with gmail should i do something to be able to do that or its just a bug
4,i really like the app but i dont know if im using it to its fullest potential has any on made a tutorial
4,simple and straightforward
4,this app is really good i want to suggest to that the app should have a rest day option or something similar that you can activate it anytime you want and while activated the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue it is useful if you are on vacation or theres an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks
4,this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work im ao happy you listen to your customers edit now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold
4,hello your app is amazing my gf and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other but i really need a list functional like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app are you going to add this sry for my english btw update and i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark its completed thank you and your team again for this great app
4,its a bit hard to set everything up but its a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style nice work dev team thanks for your time and effort
4,eu daria 5 se estivesse totalmente traduzido para português
4,this app is great overall i just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own 
4,keeps me on track
4,i like it and i would definitely pay 20 for it but i cant justify paying a subscription if only i could pay once
4,all it needs is the option to set a pic from the gallery as an icon if that happens in the next update ill give 5 stars
4,notifications fixed app keeps getting better id like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements edit nice d another thing i would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked example unlocked 01042019 so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab thanks for this app
4,great app for setting up to do list and setting skills very similar to liferpg differing only in ui and the addition of achievements in my opinion stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app would prefer one off payment to unlock features
4,needs more ranks
4,productivity gamefied as has been said before the natural successor to liferpg looks like they just ripped the source code tbh but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs pity they monetised it in every available orifice fukugly full screen ads inapp purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription all conspire to overshadow the app itself as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its gaming usp
4,a good app in general i would love to be able to have loose tasks for example practice spanish twice a week which should be completed at least twice every week also why not allow icons to be any emoji
4,its pretty nice all things considered but i have found a few problems with it mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that i mean no matter how many notify alarms i set none of them go off ive downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and ive had the same problems each time the second is that the widget will quite often display that i have no tasks when i in fact have about seven on any given day im not taking a star off because of the widget though
4,its a great app keep up the good work it has almost all features ive ever wished for in gamification but a few things were missingquite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now if it helps you i could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that i think could make this app better heres not enough space for that though please give a short answer of youd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts 
4,i liked the app very much i signed up and so with the hope that my to do list would sync with all devices but when i reinstalled the up after cleaning my phone everything disappeared 
4,no bad habits to simply punish me just could make good habits
4,looks cool and i like the stats i would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with nonrepeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view and when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display why do none of the life rpg apps ive tried not have calendars its bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again
4,so far so good i love creating my own adventure still learning some of the functions maybe a tips video could help i cant wait to see what other fun things can be added more community or friends list or leader board then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks i just like this a bunch so thank you
4,seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what ive done the previous day eg if its tuesday it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from monday which seems like a perfect thing do to on tuesday morning  
4,a very good ripoff of liferpgtaking all of the useful features of task management reward motivation and rpgstyle stat levels and making the ui simpler and more userfriendly seems to be monetizing the idea though putting in ads and lots of inapp purchases and requiring a recurring payment subscription rather than onetime purchase to unlock features
4,good concept but i dont use the app anymore as someone who is now not really a gamer the point gamelike concept seems to doesnt work for me anymore and maybe its also due to the fact that i only compete with my self if i were to compete with a friend or whoever that is maybe i can keep my self accountable but thats it to it if you are a gamer this app might gonna help you
4,this would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem i didnt like you cant choose pm or am times and its just a annoying and confusing
4,i like this app i only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience i hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved i would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough
4,i really like it i wish the icon could be custom made for example if i could use my own png files as icons that would be cool especially for achievements
4,why this app consumes so much traffic in background this month it hit the 500mb  in bg is this app free of malware elements
4,you add execution note but when i check in history it just one word that appeared and the next is  i confuse how to check the details hope the next update there is detail preview when tap a mission thats done in history and also search feature in history will be very useful to check some mission among all those missions in history thank you for great app
4,fun way to track and reward yourself guiltfree lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice my only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section
4,"update thank you for the fix also if possible can you consider adding an 
icon a way for quickly go to subtasks it helps user experience a lot 
because now we need to click  hold 2 times for go to subtasks of a parent 
task and it takes a lot of time for the tasks with many level i already 
update the rating please let me know your feedback for the above and when 
the new update is available i will change it to 5 stars regards  
please fix the add subtasks feature in subtasks list of a parent task 
when clicking on edit icon it show list of subtasks to select and a 
add subtasks link but click on it show nothing  it affects user 
experience a lot because when we need to add subtasks we need to back a 
lot to go to main task list  then add normal task  then go to parent 
task to mark it as subtask thank you it is urgent so please let me know 
your feedback then i will increase the rating"
4,"reward section should be devided into multiple catagory like item armor 
food etc to avoid difficulty in selecting one we want to buy with gold or 
you could add the feature to add a tast to costomable group we can create"
4,"i like this update however i still think this app could be better in ui 
in future could you add the visual improvement like adding progress bar in 
each characteristics and skills so we can track our progress more fun 
also just suggestions you could add health and magic point like in real rpg 
game alot people would like that i guess"
4,great app not as streamlined but ever so flexible a couple of annoyances i have with the app are the lack of icons even after purchasing the locked icons and the lack of color codinggrouping on the overview
4,excellent features but needs more exciting ui
4,"i quite enjoyed this amazing little app for a week then i realized i cant 
view my past before like 6 days if i could save it somewhere in graph form 
that wouldve been the 5th star"
4,"its a good app but it would be better if more optiosns were added in the 
repeat section like being able to choose the repeat to occur every 
secondthirdetc dayweeketc"
4,so what isthe function of coins
4,this is a great app the organization options are perfect for what i want to do i put each room of my house in as a daily bonus quest and add each task i need to do as a subtask   that way i can see the tasks needed for each room at a glance and give myself a nice bonus for full completion  my only complaint is that you cant set a custom reset or rollover time its always at midnight local time sometimes i like to lay in bed and check off all the chores i did before falling asleep and if its past midnight it becomes a pain to fix  would be great if the option for custom reset time was added
4,would give it full stars but the app crashes as soon as i open it now so i cant use it hoping that will be fixed in an update  edit for some reason i can access the app through the widget and edit the tasks but as soon as i try to click the home page it fails to load and crashes
4,i love most of this the initial setup is a bear of a thing but once thats done it is very satisfying to use as with all task management apps i wish you could have tasks repeat on only certain days of the week eg weekdays or mwf the first app to do that will make bank
4,does this app has a web version yet if so then ill definitely use it more
4,really like this app ive found it really useful would have been 5 stars but ive started having problems with adding skills to tasks with some of them not appearing after savingupdatingthis does affect the game aspect and relevant skill increases
4,first app to actually motivate me   only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the achievements have no automatic templates and cant be set with conditions connected to the autofail function that would be great for building habits
4,i love everything i just want the xp bar to have a cool animation of actually filling up in front of me its the only reasons i still use rpg lifei know its pettybut animations are important for an app
4,like it so far my only suggestion being a shop where you can buy icons or something gotta put use for the coins
4,excellent for what it advertises i wish for a way to spend the gold or use the exp that way it would provide incentive to play more for those who wish to use this app as intended
4,this app has helped me so much with motivating myself im very ill and doing simple daily tasks like eating and taking meds is exhausting this app has made it easy to track when i meet my daily goals and helps motivate me to do the things i need to take care of myself my only dissatisfaction with this app is that you cannot edit failed tasks on many occasions my goals have timed out because of the autofail feature and even though i have done the task and thought i told the app i had done the task the app tells me i failed the goal once the task is failed theres no way to edit the failed task its really upsetting when ive done the work but my goal is marked as failed for now i think i will stop using the auto fail feature
4,i really like all the features in this app but what i have two problems with this app simplicity and customization the app lacks simplicity in that its a bit hard to get started i create a task and im introduced to skills which introduce me to
4,this app so far has the cleanest ui of all the apps ive tried of this genre the task set up is so quick to use and the duplicate feature fantastic for someone like me who has to set up working out tasks with similar outlines the one thing id say is additional icons and maybe a few templates to help people get started other than the default otherwise keep up the good work
4,i really like the idea of this app its pretty easy to use and understand and if you liked dd growing up itll remind you of the character buildinglevelling processes which is great if i could make one suggestion add a falconry guy to the avatars 
4,great app a funny way of keeping your life organized i would suggest some better graphics more icons for tasks are definitely needed a hp bar to show how much time is left before sleeping which should be an adjustable parameter and an inventory feature to store your purchased rewards without immediately using them  when used they would disappear from inventory and maybe appear in the claimed section thanks for the hard work keep it up i will give 5 stars for sure as soon as these features are implemented 
4,great app only thing that needs work is the achievement tab its pretty lackluster you cant make achievements for reach x level overall like giving yourself an achievement for reaching level 5 as a hero not only for skillscarachteristics how it is currently would change to 5 stars if this gets fixed
4,achievements should have reward options such as expgold   otherwise it is a neat app
4,ive previously written a review as well as updated it which i will continue to do  i believe in this apps potential  one of the more persistent problems ive faced is with skill point distribution sometimes when i go to check the related skills of a repeating task because im not seeing the related skill points onscreen upon completion i notice that the related skills percentages have been reset i have to manually change the percentages back which can be pretty time consuming especially when it keeps happening i really wish the devs would fix that  also a suggestion i would love to see timedate for my tasks in the widget and notification windows
4,приложение хорошее однако было бы неплохо добавить календарь чтобы можно было более наглядно просматривать записи на послезавтра послепослезавтра 31 февраля и т д а также было бы неполохо добавить срок выполнения задачи в течении определенного периода а не только на конкретную дату
4,autofailed tasks should be more intuitive they dont actually fail until you visit your task list and if you failed them yesterday the points for the day you failed them dont go to that day they go to the current day so because i slacked off yesterday im starting today with like 20 gold on my chart thats not fair and it skews the stats if i didnt do something yesterday i want it to show that i didnt do something yesterday and when i autofail a task it should alert me with a notification or at least as soon as i open it to the home screen and tasks should be able to be set to just autofail at midnight without having to fiddle with the current more involved settings
4,great app but when are they going to make some ice hockey icons
4,upd пожалуйста добавьте возможность уходить в минус по итогам заваленных миссий получается нечестно что я батонюсь пропускаю задания а потом мне не нужно отдавать за них долги  очень мешает золотая иконка монеток не вписывается в дизайн сделайте ее пожалуйста в одном стиле с приложением только не меняйте на алмазы   p s купила тему чтобы немножко поддержать вас очень жду заявленного обновления  ______ перешла к вам с liferpg очень не хватает функции добавления иконок для миссий в идеале  кастомных с галереи и родительскихдочерних миссий хотя с ними сопряжено большинство багов  мне очень нравится приложение а главное его отзывчивый разработчик я продолжу пользоваться спасибо
4,a bit of headache in beginning but awesome
4,it was great while it worked fell in love with this app but after maybe a week of using it stopped working a bug perhaps but when i went to add tasks it froze and didnt let me do anything and even deleting and reinstalling didnt help im sad that i have to replace this app i really did like it a lot
4,great app an alarm would be great with new or better icons in context with the app
4,i really like the idea and would of easily voted 5 on it but it has no alerts or alarms on mine to remind me to do the set task doesnt even send me a notification
4,this is a good app for motivation
4,i like the app as a to do list however it needs an am or pm function on the time
4,i believe its awesome but for the next update can you please use    instead of    in front of numbers it looks like a minus symbol
4,it was fantastic until it started freezing every time i went to tasks is there a way to fix this
4,im only a few days in but it seems to be working only complaint so far is that it would be good to have the xp show on the task list next to the task or have the gold reward automatically scale with the xp so i have motivation to do the harder for me tasks without having to work out how much gold i think it is worth
4,although a very useful app i would like it to have a more medieval rpg theme to it rather than the modern theme that it currently has i would also like to be able to set some skills and characteristics to decrease over time  aside from that the app is great
4,love the app i wish there were more features such as adding icons to tasks or adding a quest map
4,widget finished task should be gone it bother me that its still with my task at hand
4,nice app best of the ones ive tried but really think about adding some graphics and a much less boring ui look at superbetter for instance also a multiplayer aspect is a glaring omission that almost all your competitors have  try to have stats actually have some meaning or  a way for us to give them meaning
4,edit for some reason the timezone of the app is not the same as my actual timezone tasks are overdue even though the day is not over for me however its still a great app with lots of potential i like the slick interface and the whole concept once you can differentiate the characteristics from the skills the fun begins keep improving this app its definitely my favorite rpg lifestyle app
4,could we customize notification sound for successful tasks i want to add final fantasy victory theme but still dont know how to besides that i really like this apps
4,as someone that has played several mmorpgs im excited to use this i made my first task for cleaning the kitchen and worded it in a way youd find in an rpg quest simply for self amusement i think it would be a really cool update to have our hero icon image start off as a type youd see in an rpg such as ranger mage or paladin and maybe even more to pick from in novice armor related to their character type and as the hero goes up in mastery their armor would get better
4,just work on the notifications they are working rather strange and add some better visualization
4,hi im using nexus 5x as a gamer i definitely like it however nowadays while im checkingmaking task the app always crashnot responding i only rate 4stars because of it kindly fix thanks
5,by far the most indepth app of this style tried habitica and others and they were so underdeveloped in comparison in my opinion
5,this app is very customizable which i definitely wanted in an rpg style to do list however it does come at a cost since getting everything set up how youd like takes much longer than similar apps personally i think the trade is worth it hence my rating but be aware that if youre looking for something more simple this probably isnt the app for you if you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work pick this one over the others
5,it would be nice to have the ability to set an xpcoins decay until a particular task is completed also would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time rather than editing its time and resetting it or duplicating it also maybe add search ability for filtering icons as there are so many
5,the most fullyfeatured task tracking app ive seen a little daunting at first i recommend ignoring a lot of the xp sliders and special options until you are used to the general mechanics once you realize you can ignore or tweak any mechanics you dislike its value shines through theres enough options in the mechanics that you can use what systems you like and ignore the rest
5,great software for those who want to succeed i have been using this software for a year and i am completely satisfied with it install it right now
5,perfect i serched to many apps like this but finally i find you best app for upgrade your life u are my hero and i am a premium user now thank you dear dev 
5,really helps me to keep motivated to keep my workouts or chores and its so easy to use
5,good app relatively easy with out being too simplistic rpg aspects are engaging but not excessively time consuming calendar is paid access which is a little annoying but certainly understandable popup ads are mostly brief as should be and far enough between they are acceptable enough all in all best rpg todo list ive tried
5,wow ive only had this for a few hours but i love all the features and i think this is going to be super helpful amazing app i will definitely be upgrading to pro at some point
5,been using it for a few days now has really helped me focus on and organize tasks even simple ones like making the bed or brushing my dog things i always skip at least a couple times a week dont even really feel the need to get the pro version because of how useful the free one is
5,you have to spend some time setting up everything such that it fits your goals and your personality etc  but its worth the effort
5,just what i was looking for simple logic no unnecessary filling functions great design
5,awesome reminder app this one actually motivates you to complete tasks because it shows you your progress and the ui is easy to use its very customizable from being able to choose the icon of a task to allowing you to create an unlimited number of tasks the free version also allows the use of almost all of its features and doesnt hinder you in any way im considering getting a subscription but mostly because i want to support the creators of the app that has improved my daily life
5,love it the game element to it really gives me motivation to complete my tasks i can create loads of tasks and give myself rewards to work todays really cool 
5,this has been the most straight forward gamify your life app i love that it lets you add your own skills and have a task increase or decrease a skill i also like that it allows you add your own pictures for each different level that you advance as you fulfill your taks improvements needed would be to explain the metrics percentages and other customization that is not entirely clear how to use
5,i love this app life is like a game for me and this application helps to improve myself in a fun way
5,love the app and the fact the devs listen and add new updates all the time
5,i just started the app a few days ago and i really like it i told my kids it would have been nice to have this when they were young the fight for chores might have been a little less of a struggle
5,so far its a great way to keep track of daily tasks and stay motivated on selfcare
5,great app it helped me get my life together
5,this app has been life changing its perfect for people who are strategic and motivated by growing as a person
5,love it incredibly useful and i feel like a superhero growing in a gamification style system that tracks my lifestyle and productivity great product the only thing i need is an online opportunity it is hard to use the interface exclusively on the phone because it is such an interactive interface this would really expand on the product usage i cant pull my phone out at work but could open a website
5,excelente app e com possobilidades infinitas se você for criativo
5,absolutely love it this is by far the greatest app for gamification i use this app to implement new and creative ideas in notion i wonder if the developers know about notion and gamification setup in notion it has been a huge help
5,tried 3 top rated at time as once a pen  paper dungeon master i found this app to be a nice blend of functionality and fantasy the interface is user friendly and subscreens are nicely interconnected easy to navigate would benefit from a little more initial guidance particularly with specific intended use of the various percentage settings and groups  sub tasks but overall so far very happy wish calendar wasnt paid but certainly understand so far no obnoxious ads
5,великолепное приложение отзывчивая поддержка отличный дизайн продуманная и удобная система развития очень интересно ставить себе и родным задачи и вознаграждение за них рекомендую
5,i really like this app i appreciate how much thought has been put into it but it is complicated app i wish there was a video to understand all features even though the help document is quite thorough
5,挺好用的挺好玩的而且还可以同步
5,its a great app just the one that ive been looking for its a bit overwhelming at first since im still starting with activities i want to write about but i got to customizing my wants after a week i hope this app will keep on improving and then ill subscribe in the future as a support for the developers
5,edit this one complaint has been fixed its perfect now i really love this app and i use it everyday the new black and orange theme is really nice to look at my only feedback is that i wish the color of the widget changed to match the chosen inapp theme because the yellow list kinda sticks out from my background other than that the app is perfect thank a lot levor
5,i have only spent a day with this app but i know that i will spend a great deal of time with it in the future pros highly versatile and fast this app can be designed to fit any goal and can be tuned to fit any rpg balancing you want nearly everything is customizable its also fast from first tap of the app to checking off accomplished tasks it takes just a couple seconds cons perfecting the customization to the rpg experience you want can take a long time but its worth it
5,this app makes creating new habits more fun by making it feel like a game
5,i love using this app for myself to help me prioritizeorganize my time for school homework and playing one thing i would love to see in here is an option where you can have multiple characters so a parent can get the app on their phone and make a character for each child so that they can keep track of what their child has done and what rewards they can have ex playing games extra dessert screen time etc
5,классное приложение не все функции доступны в бесплатной версии но их вполне хватает заполнение всех заданий и их вес опыт монетки очень простое и не нудное можно поставить себе награды за выполнение дел все круто
5,lots of control  customization of tasks  rewards could benefit from some additional features but no app has everything been using for 2 weeks  its helping me accomplish important tasks i usually lack motivation to do
5,its great for planning out goals of any time frame whether it be short or long term its also extremely customizable which i adore a lot
5,great app i would love to buy it for lifetime but the price is too steep for a student in india hopefully like netflix and spotify etc have done with their prices for india you can give us some price which will be affordable in our country
5,fun way to manage tasks and improve yourself
5,such an organized convenient way to keep track of my life
5,they should change the name have no idea it would be awesome just from the name
5,good yes me like
5,i honestly love this app its a great way to keep track of everything you need to do and its very versatile allowing you to customize tasks in a wide variety of ways only thing its missing is a version i can use on my laptop i might have to get bluestacks running 
5,great app i wish the one time payment wasnt so absurdly expensive but its definitely worth using
5,dont import its resets evryfing to defult
5,this app has helped me keep on track and get better habits
5,canny ive been jogging cleaned the houseand took the dog for a walk recommended
5,as a lifetime gamer and task lister this app seems bespoke to me thanks for making it
5,really motivates
5,hands down one of the best apps for productivity to do etc or maybe the best one on the market thanks taras
5,hi i love the app theres a bug that i want to share i created a daily task once a day but it doesnt go away after completing it from todays task what do i do thank you edit gonna subscribe soon can you add sounds when consuming items please thanks
5,i have only had it for a few days and dont fully understand every feature but it is the only to do list app that has so far worked for me probably because of it being based on a reward system even if the rewards are only virtual
5,great app for goal setting  tracking in a gamified way
5,i love it incredibly customizable keeps me on track to do the things i want to do
5,wow this is such an exciting way to try to organise and get motivated to do more of the things i mean to do each day and with my lifei still dont understand a lot of how to make it work but its great fun finding out and seems to be very customisable to make it fun to build your skills and habits you want to develop in life to get to your aims when i get enough money i will definitely buy the app as i think the developer has made a really great way totry2get my life to how i want it to be
5,adorei é perfeito
5,its designed as a todo app with game mechanics on top of it not the other way around  the simplicity feels like any other android app although the interface can take 15 mins to get used to and then some more
5,if life is a simulation then the only way to win is to take meticulous control of your life to live it for as long as you can think minecraft of the future life is peaceful during day but night time eventually comes 2020 is night time however you can survive it when things get peaceful againwhenever it does prepare further for nighttime figure out your stats figure out your level and continue to level up more efficiently every time theres always room for improvement
5,very active app
5,when will this app be added to the microsoft store for pc edited ive noticed that when i perform a execution it doesnt always leaves from the list of todays executions can i fix that by settings or is it a bug
5,i think its a pretty straightforward app it definitely helps when you need to place certain tasks throughout your week as a reminder
5,most amazing task organizer everything is customizable and easy to understand functions perfectly whether you use every detail of the app or just basic task lists im pavloving myself with the task completion noise and my serotonin levels are through the roof ive never wanted to give anyone money before but i 100 would buy every addon even though i dont need to because i can do almost everything for free hooray thank you so much
5,amazing this app has had a really large positive impact on my life in just a few short months would definitely reccommend 
5,its the best task gamification app i have ever seen even if you dont need the gamification its still better than most other to do apps in task organization edit  if you are capable please add the option of adding files to tasks like some other to do apps
5,love the app but i have a question i have a morning routine set up with subtasks is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab also i would love it if i could order my tasks customly without having to assign a time to them this is by far the best app i have found for setting to dos for yourself as an adult with adhd i love the fun childish functionality without it looking like a childs game on my phone
5,some of it is a little unintuitive but overall this is an awesome and free app
5,encourages me to complete task
5,i love the app and its customizablity with some notes repeats are confusing and not easy to work about for instance repeat times during one day versus general repeats moving tasks to different days calendar drag  can set specific times on multiple reminders making routines changes easy to lose when pressing back and unable to manually order tasks by preference in list form adding stars for great responsiveness and care of creator d
5,the developer is pure genius well execution on customizable gamification app execution i have bought a subscription as soon as using it for 10 minutes i would like to make a business inquiry is the contact information listed here updated do you check your emails often i am looking for a firm communication channel with the developer
5,started few days ago so far its good
5,this is a great app i recommend a search bar though for both skills and characteristics
5,rpg bolado
5,this app is just what i needed to make progress on my goals contains a whole bunch of features and customisability it is also easy to use i only have an issue with the task list widget not updating properly after completing a task
5,ive been doing this for several days and its been working wonders
5,everything is able to be modified you can gamify whatever you want of your day a day life it would be nice to sort tasks as you wish just moving them in the order you want without needing to rename them or other tricks to put them in the order you like however still being quite good for everything it offers
5,hi i just started using this app a few days ago and im absolutely blown away its kept me on track for a bunch of my activities and the ui is so customisable while being clean i have a minor suggestion about if progress bars to recurrent activities can be added eg im reading a book and have that as a recurring task but id like a slide bar to be able to advance my progress daily subtasks dont show in the widget as well this app is still amazing and great work on everything so far
5,the best app you can find of this kind it is well built creative and regularly updated with this app you dont need any other planning or todo list apps it is completely worth buying i gladly payed full price for this high quality app
5,probably the best task managing app out there
5,this is the best most customizable app around i appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such the app has grown over the years and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes its actually spoiled me from installing other similar style apps again simply because i can just make everything to my taste all in one app it really makes keeping a schedule feel like less of a chore and for a gamer like me thats golden real life questing is fun
5,awesome app overall it would be great to see some kind of progress functionality inside tasks for example counter 010or any other number you input for pushups  book pages  words learned etc
5,its not that bad
5,this app is brilliant clean simple and ultimately customizable ive been wanting something like this for a while
5,awesome app the best ive ever used
5,the app is great there are so many features actually you create your own game i didnt notice any ad even with a free account you can donate 1 dollar to support developers with cup of coffee  edit still love the app enjoy your coffee taras 
5,fun versatile
5,such a good idea very generous to help us out for free helps me recognize my accomplishments instead of dismissing them and losing track of how much progress im making would recommend having essential daily tasks prescheduled so that theyre easy to tick off the list but writing in unique events only after theyve been accomplished in order to maintain intrinsic motivation memory and your capacity to selfmonitor use this to record progress not replace internal selfdetermination
5,only complaint is how often it asks you to rate it other than that the app is even so great imo that its work buying the subscription i love how customizable it is for sure one of my top 5 favorite apps
5,im having lots of fun i feel motivated to do more in the day so far i have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need i just hope it will work for me long term
5,its pretty cool app very convenient to customer everything and really immerse into the game which is your life
5,very good app for complete tracking
5,great app changing my life
5,really cute but im more into minimalist designs it works really well tho if the interface seems like ur thing i like that they have a reward system i might just get it back just for that bc no other app that ive seen has that
5,life is like a video game the free version very detailed organization with a clean look but well worth the time it takes to figure out
5,great app i am trying to find an application like this one for a while if you are looking for an app that will help you grow this is the one for you you have multiple skills to choose from also you can create your own i love that they had programming and an icon of python to choose to get the full features you need to purchase the application however you dont need to buy or watch annoying adds to use the application
5,best habbit app
5,really fun and thorough 
5,i need more options of anything
5,best task app ever
5,great app lets you customize pretty much anything you want to create your own system only reward app i kept coming back to has helped me to create change in my life
5,i need the application thanks developers 
5,very fun app lots of customization and a very polished app some features are blocked unless you paycalender and some icons they arent needed to enjoy the app though cant complain it works great reminding and motivating me to get stuff done 
5,exceptional
5,this app is amazing im having fun just setting up that being said an optional progress bar for tasks would be really helpful
5,great app makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun
5,i love this app i had tried habit rpg and i liked the generalized idea behind it but wished it was more in depth  video game like that you could not only lvl up but gain skill points this is extremely detailed even has characteristics you can lvl up as well as skills  allows for complete customization in everything being a nerd  someone who lacks discipline i forsee this to be an extremely useful tool to help me stay on task achieve my goals and feel like i am actually lvling up irl
5,it really feels like i have a tabletop character sheet for myself and i didnt even know i wanted it until now the skill and stat customization is incredibly deep the reward system is great i highly recommend the premium if you can afford it these devs deserve it and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions
5,beautiful and detailed app there are two features that would make it more useful 1 a counter to keep track of quantity example alcohol drinks 2 a limit which causes a fail if you go over example limit 14 drinks in a week or 2 per day
5,this is cool im on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading you can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity as well as penalties for failure you can even link customizable titles to your level progression my personal goal archwizard of the order of ptolemy very few features are locked behind the paywall and everything that is essential is free
5,excellent way to gamify your personal habits with many levels of customization so you can set the difficulty levels of tasks as well as the level of self improvement those tasks provide
5,its a great app
5,thanks for this perfect app how i can use coins how i can buy with coins
5,great idea managing yourself like playing game
5,fun way to track tasks
5,nice app very use full
5,linking tasks to higher level skills  characteristics and then seeing them increase is perfect motivation for me
5,its a really great app i love most that it reminds you about your tasks since i tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants its easy and fun to use especially with the reward system i think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly i love the app its perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need
5,just installed this yesterday loved it love the concept love the design too bad the free version cant have access to the calendar  but otherwise its a great app am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium
5,it really really good
5,seems to be useful so far
5,awesome app to gamify tasks ive been using it for 3 months and i love many things about it i wont write them because i can only type 500 characters but i wish it could include time tracking like the one from toggl also i strongly wish it could have a desktop version and ios another thing would be to sincronize with a google calendar not only the one inside the app i also think the calendar needs accuracy lastly being able to interact with other users and a ranking would be great
5,the idea is just wow well executed
5,out of all the rpg themed productivity apps out there this one has certainly met my needs to whoever who comes up with the idea and design of this app you certainly created a miracle for a guy like me thank you so much for creating this app dear developers ps ill be giving this app a proper review one day after a few weeks  months of using this  till again youve certainly created a great future for me through this app man 
5,great work mates
5,really loving this app ive used a couple other productivity apps but this is the first one ive really stuck too turns out failing tasks and losing points really motivates me was wondering if its possible to get bonus points for completing tasks in succession think it would help with habit formation otherwise does everything i need it to and really happy with it great job
5,great productivity app to stay organized
5,i really love this app its fantastic in many ways i wish i could adjust the overdue settings as tasks are set as overdue too quickly for me 
5,does everything i want it to do and more
5,amazing app you can literally modify everything into the way you prefer its a little complex but with only minutes you can understand its interface and fall in love with it i love it even more because you can go up levels and it makes really more fun doing your tasks no ads and almost everything for free pretty amazing
5,i love this app it has so many features and i love the creator listens to the apps reviews thats rare and when it happens i have to give props to the creator if there is a feature i would like its items that can change your current photo temporarily this app is a 10  app and i highly recommend it
5,ive only had this app for a couple of days but its already helped me so much ive tried a lot of plannertype apps but i never felt motivated to follow through with them this app allows you to make schedules and tasks and it has a reward system in place ive had a hard time focusing with all this online school stuff but my productivity has shot up due to this app  definitely worth a try thank you devs
5,hmm i like it
5,it has everything you truly need with a degree of complexity besides its versatile liberty to do many things thanks for the app no adds seriously congrats
5,hello can you please add in your godlike widget transparent theme i really need in this 
5,i like it i waited purposely almost 3 weeks in order to give here a true opinion this application is amazing because it has so many possibilities like everything is open for you you can set anything this is why i recommend to whom wants to use it to take the time to understand as it works read the user guide included in the app so you can set the application to your exact goal so at the beginning it may not so clear and maybe there are more friendly use apps but this one in adjustable
5,this is my first time with a rpg but i love this to do list
5,gufy
5,this app is great i was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this rpg style game which i can even customize has proved to be most efficienti would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level upit will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time
5,so far loving this app
5,i enjoy this app because i am a task oriented person and i can see how much i have completed and the xp gaming quality to it makes me feel like i m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work
5,very easy to personalise and use 5
5,love the app its much fun engaging and helpful to stay focused on your goals and developing new habits much better than competing apps habitica comes to mind even if they have better social integration of course one can always add new features and improve design elements but if you are looking for a task manager look no further this is the best on the market highly engaging and fun to interact with
5,as a fan of rpgs and a slacker who needs encouragement to do things besides play video games i have to say this is the greatest app ever its so much fun
5,i enjoy using this app it makes habit tracking fun and entertaining
5,this app is really great easy to keep track of all my many activities
5,best life rpg app that i could find support is very helpful and fast at responding everything other app i tried was all about them milking money but not this one
5,great its been helping me a lot
5,es buena para aser mis abitos y mis tareas tiene muchas occiones
5,one of the bests todo apps
5,fun way to celebrate your accomplishments
5,i love it the app but why is so expensive perhaps more cheap help us to buy it
5,life changing app for someone who loves rpg game so much like me making myself the avatar in real life helps much to change my own attitude to work and lifestyle my only comment is to allow description for every hero statuses and maybe in the future the icon will look more appealing with colors also for premium members let them be able to have several heroes at once this will inspire people to work on different aspect of their life more closely thank you for makin such an amazing app
5,great app could suggest rewards that fit the task type offer actual customer  icon customization and allow linkage of tasks to overarching goals that have separate rewards attached other than that  best app like this i can find  a lot of great features
5,been using the app for a couple of weeks and have lost 4lbs already took a bit of setting up with the tasks and rewards but it is very customisable gamifying my life might be just the thing i need to get into better habits and lose some weight
5,this is an amazing app youre able to customize almost everything to what you want there are some things id love to see added though some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice and being able to have a task directly award you with an item too developers if you see this you have done an amazing job ill be getting the in app subscription soon to support you
5,great app which has everything i need its not very easy at first but the result it gives is worth the effort i like that you can see your characteristics in a diagram and how customizable everything is thank you
5,best motivational game style to do list app ive tried subscription cost is very reasonable and the free version is great too definitely recommend
5,lets me focus on working out and ect the rewards are good from me going to the scale i lost more than 50 pounds good for activities and exercise i hope you enjoy it as well because i have a reason to give it a five star rating i have set the reward to make me improve better and make it all a more of a challenge thank you creators for giving me this inspiration to do better and be more healthy i will continue using this app for the rest of my life  enjoyable of this app  mogginz
5,this app makes me so much more productive
5,its a really great app although it would be better if you could use costom icons for tasks and rewards and it would be better if the app didnt blur low quality pictures as i like to use pixelated pictures i also love the fact that this app works offline thank you for the great work 
5,estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse
5,very neat
5,overall very good u can edit the skills and characteristics u want and edit the rewards as well i just want to suggest can u add a feature where we could interact with other users or create a group according to the skills and characteristics that we have in that way we can also get rewards for our grp and loose our stamina health if we wont be able to do task these will trigger us more to participate  ill purchase the calendar soon if school will be back thanks
5,first of all its an excellent app i like the fact that it is highly customizable however id like to make a suggestion your app lacks the emotional aspect a bit i suggest to add support of small custom avatarlike images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons this way a task will associate with something positiveinspirational pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen do not understimate the power of visual associations
5,cest la meilleure application pour vaincre la procrastination
5,in a weird way its cool to level up doing mundane tasks
5,great app for a todo list with a hint of gamer mentality
5,very nice takes effort to customize but can be a useful tool
5,great app i paid for the pro version i like the customice options to create character traits and unique skills pls upload a yoga and a meditation icon 
5,why nobody said about the app missing a fail task buttonits been so hard and time consuming to just fail some tasks its the best app from this category besides this minor flaw
5,i actually want to complete tasks and see how much i can level up each day i love it its a game now not a chore d
5,very good so far
5,дякую
5,this app is so cool its geared towards complete configuration from the user so give your goals the time they deserve and map it out once you get through learning the app it will be an awesome tool for your future development
5,although i ended up settling on a different tracking method this app is nice it offers tons of customization options edit what personally ended up working for me unexpectedly was just a lowtech checklist lol still praises to this apps design options 
5,im a gamer and dislike doing chores this gives incentive
5,i have had zero motivation to do anything lately with the whole cortana thing going on but this really helps me get things done
5,a frightfully creative and entertaining way getting your tasks done 
5,if you see this taras or other developers i believe your app would benefit immensely and more people will download it if you were to implement an online feature or a way to access on any device such as a computer if you would upload a website with this apps interface and sync to the cloud more people would be able to access it meaning more profit which would mean more great reviews etc if you were to add this feature like habitica has i and more people will likely buy the subscription
5,best gamify your todolist  productivity app really recommend it to everyone
5,рекомендуюотличное приложение я вернулся и снова сразу подписался реквестизза большого количества опций и настроек часто тратишь много времени на заполнения всей инфы о задачахя бы очень хотел увидеть возможность добавления стандартных параметров для пользовательских групп задачк примеру у меня есть to do лист и скажем книги хотелось бы чтобы при добавлении задач на прямую в группу подтягивалась иконка с цветом длительность повторение и др параметрыи побольше иконок для платной
5,wonderful app thank you developer please keep update
5,amazing system some what hard to balance custom goals without someone elses help but fun and helpfully none the less 
5,aww man glad i found this love rpg games and this is a great incentive to get stuff done just wish the full version wasnt almost 60 bucks or a subscription fee lil much for a reminder app
1,no end of task habit days so useless
1,doesnt worth its price there are better alternatives for cheaper prices many crucial features are not there yet like synchronization and theyre not developing anything anymore btw i also cant believe that there are still softwares that use sunday as a first day of the week in which century you are living in guys
1,if you give 10 habits creating system in free versionit will be betterbut you should not give under 10 habits system in this app lest useless app maybesobe careful it and tasks priority shorting system and priority show on task or habits screen have to add thenit will be better app
1,worst routine app i ever seen  literly worst and really a bad app i set a reminder for a day to go to market but it doesnot remind me  i always check my phone when any of notification appears but i set alarm for a task it doesnot give me any notification and wasnot rings any of alarm please donot downloaded this it was really a worst app if you download it you just waist your time and data  worst app 
1,its ok missing so many features not user friendly realized that after got the paid version
1,very worst app
1,este é um ótimo aplicativo eu melhorei muito e mudei meus hábitos também eu realmente gosto desse app obrigado
1,limits habits to like 6 or whatever unless you pay useless
1,only 7 free habits
1,this what is really useful to me it is useful to manage my time it is the good app for time management i prefer download this app and and use
1,its the worst app ever doesnt give any reminder doesnt work  just a waste of time 
1,this app is a scam it does not work at all nothing is real here from the first day i used it it refused to work at all
1,the have a limit on how much habits you can add for free going to u install
1,no notification showing
1,really dark mode behind a pay wall
1,i have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes ive decided its not for me i couldnt set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed
1,it is a super app i wouldnt forget my activity
1,not sure why but it doesnt seem to alert you or at least does intermittently after its first alert for example i had a habit to check a website every day at 1100 to check for updates it worked the first time however i get no other updates thereafter not much ise if theres no consistency
1,it never alerts me only gives notifications when you open the app
1,it was confusing
1,no reminders
1,if you want to use dark mode youll have to but premium i understand the need to make money off your app but thats just scummy
1,i got the premium version the main drawbacks of this app are 1 i cannot customize the categories 2 if i do a task earlier it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3 removing done tasks is not available just moved to the bottom
1,costs money to make pixels darker
1,terrible cant control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit stupidly paid for the premium upfront agree with others that idk where 46 came from
1,it doesnt remind me i even forgot i still had it on my phone
1,alarms or notifications dont work unless you open the app then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app defeats the purpose of the app tedious roundabout way to delete a habit compared to deleting a task not sure how this app got a 46 rating
1,zero integration with any calendar so literally worthless
1,dont receive any notifications alarms
1,you have to pay for the dark mode really it doesnt mattee how helpful this app could be for my life if it damages my eyes a lot more just because i cant afford to go premium and buy the amazing dark mode at least those whole 2 seconds of interacting with the app were fun
1,limited habits
1,its says error when copying data when i tried to export data can you please mail me the solution again please
1,absolutely hated it it was just weird
1,its not working properly
1,too expensive
1,not advisable to anyone
1,couldnt edit any habit in this apps cant add pages episodes and liters bec theyre not available in the edit menu the only way to edit a habit is to delete it
1,app has too many error to count
2,it beautifully displays tracks and reports all of my important habits that i want to develop unfortunately it doesnt have an option to set recurring tasks  things that i need to do regularly but that arent necessarily vital to my personal development i paid for the full version but actually stopped using it because i dont like that it wont differentiate between a habit and a recurring task looking for something to better suit my needs 
2,dark mode in premium
2,can not shut off notifications they keep turning back on
2,you can only add 7 habit for free version
2,i like the app except im having trouble with my reminders my alarms and notifications only come through when the app is in use as soon as i exit the app i dont get any alarms or notifications for the times i set them until i open the app again then all these alarms and notifications ive missed pop up really quite inconvenient
2,it was great for the first couple of months later on lost track of reminders and notifications it would notify hours later so i had to remove the app just confused and ruined my plans for the day ahead
2,needs tactile completion reward of some kind also i dont like how a completed task stays on the list and looks almost like it hasnt been done yet
2,habitnow looks like a great app but it doesnt have an easy backup protocol thats a complete deal breaker
2,aaah i really like this app but too bad i cant backup to another devices  i already purchase for premiun user
2,update killed it a few months ago the notes were all wrongly ordered pointed out the issues to the developer 15 months ago but no fix till date giving up on this app
2,seems ok it was not made obvious that you have to pay to get unlimited habits so was a waste of my time
2,cool idea but i never got any of the notifications which is kinda the whole point
2,its good but for some reason it keeps switching around everything and i cant seem to move them around so i have to delete them and start again a bit frustrating but has a great purpose
2,i write only 7goalsbecause the program did not accept i like this app
2,paywall for nice features overpriced for what it does 5 for dark mode get out of here
2,ui seems quite simple not overly complex can only add x5x edit  7 habits before having to pay hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying for premium i struggle to see how the cost matchs what you get in return edit for me the habits are far more important than tasks which i can track using native apps i feel like to get the full experience of that app there should be no limitations for a period of time before committing to spending anything on the app
2,cant see all habbits report in one screen when by mistake you delete a habbit never can see again any where your previous data
2,you need to pay its not really free
2,not worth it doesnt have multiple times a day you cant change a habit after initial setup the interface is painful get something better
2,im very sorry i bought the full version so quickly the only benefit i found so far is the ability to add more than 7 habits i couldnt find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that i seem to regularly miss i was drawn to the simple ui but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to daily tasks
2,pretty solid app does what it seems but one problem for me is that the alarms dont go off when theyre supposed to instead of going off at the time i set they all go off next time i open the app they never go off until i open the app so theyre useless
2,great idea but does not give notifications for me which was really the thing i was looking for
2,no habits library
2,i dont get this app
3,now a days almost all app give you dark mode out of cost but this app gives us as a premium feature cant edit the start date either needed to delete and start again
3,cant really use it without the ability to create your own categories
3,i wanna like it but i need it to allow me to set my routine to repeat every day without having to rewrite my routine for every day or am i missing something
3,not bad but you cant check tomorrows habit today and you cant change first day of the week what is joke
3,sahi h
3,notification and alarm will automatically turn on even if i have turned off before
3,enjoying this app in general but notifications dont appear at the set time and instead just pop up randomly during the day ive now unchecked the remind me to use the app setting and hopefully the erratic notifications will stop but otherwise its quite good
3,limited habit data
3,good app but it would be great if we could add categories of our ownalso some more widgets would be usefulsuch as one for tasks and for a single habitetcand it would be awesome if there was like a sharing boardto share our progress with other users if the app and compete with friends in a group and be accountable for each otherit would be reallly helpful in the habit forming process love your appplease consider these changes
3,great so far i only wish i could set up one task for more than 1 day its kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily if i could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing also making it so i can choose a time range would also be really helpful some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now i can only choose a time for a reminder itll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these thanks
3,i feel that there should be an option to keep track of a habit which we repeat multiple times in a day update thanks your quick response i dont see a multiple repeat for the same day if i want to track a habit 3 times a day there is no option for that there is an option only to repeat multiple times a week but not mutiple times a day
3,one or two more inserting option to be given with basic arithmatic calculations to find quality of a habit for ex no of repititions divided by total time taken etc ex no of something finished divided by total time taken will give the quality
3,too bad dark mode is premium only i moved to another app immediately so i cant really judge how good is it the dark mode is a deal breaker to me when other apps are providing it for free i usually check my progress at night before bed my eyes would appreciate a dark ui
3,it igood
3,app seems okay but i created like 5 habits and then was told to upgrade to the premium version not cool
3,why i does not able to add task on a specifically day of every week
3,i have 3 issues 1 habit gets ticked even if we touch it by accident it would be better if there was option to press for some time in order to get habit ticked 2 another feature required if we have 10 habits to get done today  we complete 710 then it would show todays productivity as 70 3 there should be a feature to decrease the font size of habit  i would like to know if you have some product with this feature then i am ready to purchase if you could answer me this thanks
3,it would be 5 stars if could sinc it with other device
3,nice one but i cant amend schedule days after habit saved
3,not worth it if you cant go pro
3,ok so its not bad but for me it was a little bit hard to work but dont get me wrong there are probably loads of people that do understand it it was just a little hard for me 
3,good easy to use app but alarms dont go off unless youre on the app havent tested notifications yet
3,very good job a postpone option is needed its a priority i believe also would like option for completed habits to hide for the day and option to edit categories names icons and colours
3,i love it so far but is there a way to track ur stats over time
3,love how it looks and  success but hate that once you make a habit you cant change it i had a habit going for only weekdays but a month later i wanted to change it to every day i either had to leave it or lose all the data so far
3,had the free version it was okay nothing that was super helpful
3,very disappointed that you have a very limited amount of habits and you require premium to be removed i feel it should be lifted
3,le mode alarme ne fonctionne pas bien
3,could you please add sub tasks and checklist and also to add new category
3,i havent found the way to edit the days of the week for one habit
3,theek hai
3,i dont like u use numbers instead of yes or no but it doesnt show any difference on the calendar eg color difference
3,firstly thanks for your quick responses back i appreciate it ok so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app because theres no tutorial for that part when i click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph theres nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created
3,great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points
3,you can have just 5 habits for free we should have more
3,please add data synchronisation with google driveso when we change device we can get our old data on signing in
3,i like this app and i bought premium even it was a little expensive 549 euro what i dont like is habits with a numeric value dont allow at least 0 times a day if you want to do something 6 times a week with the possibility to do it twice on one day it will stay undone the other days 1  taskshabits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom too 1  whitout premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits after a removal of any named defect i will change my rating
3,i like this app its simple and gets the job done only downside is youre allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version
3,my personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app the two things i want to do when building a new habit are 1 easily enter the stats for the habits im tracking and 2 see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard this app focuses on todays tasks so getting to the specific habits entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome
3,setting habits was not simple enough and at the same time was missing options it kept telling me to choose a number i would press next and same error
3,i cant arrange my habits in the order i want i have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical
3,i did like the appafter im reinstalling the appwhat happens to my in app purchasei had purchased the apprt now which im using is it the paid one or free one do i need to pay for premium again
3,unable to edit the day you want to do your habit unless i delete and recreate the habit which means i would lose my past statistics
3,it has almost everything that i need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view thats really the most important thing to see how many days youve tracked in a row switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything you have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like
3,i have enough credit but i cant purchase for premium
3,i dont get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so i am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app
3,seems like it could have been great for me however lack of ability to modify repeating schedule eg which days of the week is a blocker switched to habithub for now
3,unfortunately the free version does not provide enough functionality for me i am trying to track habits but it stopped me at 7
3,this app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval for example every two weeks or every 5th of the month there is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences this was unfortunately a dealbreaker
3,two requests please 1 allow the user to set what time the dayrecurrent tasks reset not everyones day ends at midnight 2 propagate the theme selected to the widget if i have selected a dark blue theme my widget should have the same dark blue icons not a bright red habitnow one good so far more customization would make it greatthanks
3,its very useful so far however im not sure if you can change your daily routine i made one for monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week whereas i need them different and when i go to try and add a new task to my day that i want it changes it for all of them disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass thatmight as well go back to pen and paper
3,cant set times for when tasks need to be completed cant tick off tasks for the next day
3,dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive
3,guys please assist me on notification no notification on my one plus 6 ive paid premium  problem still persist even theres no battery saver nor notification blocker turned on please advise  thanks
3,ui needs major improvements the only app i believe which give quantitative habits also not just binary like 4 pages to read statistics based on that can be improved but nevertheless kudos for the idea this is only app which gives upto 7 habits in free version so keeping it else due to ui would have rejected long time back current apps in market give 3 or 5 max
3,i would give 5 stars if it had the feature to rearrange the items with your specific order instead or being predetermined
3,tasks cannot be ordered by their time a habit not done is not shown as overdue edit i checked again to use it but 1 recurring task cannot be created 2 habits are shown like scheduled tasks its motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3 its more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day if we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 12 today 160 total instead of 030 or 130
3,decent simple just a bit too simple for me i thought the percentages counted for task progress s though it were a whole project unfortunately it seems to only relate to habits id like to see subtasks and then percentage competed at least the habit statistics are clear and aesthetically pleasing
3,its a good app but i think thers some glitch i cant have more than 6 tasks when i create one it just dosent show
3,lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them if you do fix it i will purchase this app
3,for 499 to 999 id like more widgets and customization as it stands the main widget list is block white
4,please give google login option so i can backup my data easily
4,reminder notification not notified when its time that i have set at first it working well but now idk what happened i checked every settings in app and my phone settings there seems to be normal edit okay mb its huawei battery optimizer that auto optimized the app in default settings id forgotten star added to 4 i know this app could be better than this ex add option for habit that already mark as done today getting no more notifications
4,hello i really like your app but i am not able to turn off notifications every time i turn them off they just turn on when next entering the settings screen could you fix this please i am using a galaxy a71
4,this app is really nice and makes me to build good habits but only thing is annoying in this app is you cant import more than 7 habits until you get premium
4,im loving how i have set it up so i record behaviour that i want to change stop or improve and it motivates me to see those ticks at the end of the day only thing is when i turn off all notifications they immediately turn themselves back on otherwise excellent
4,i like it for now but even after buying the premium version there are a limited number of categories i have 3 businesses  thus the single briefcase icon doesnt work for me i would like to be able have a different category icon for each of my various tasks  a larger range of icon options of categories available there isnt even an icon for pets  that is super important 
4,best hai ji
4,its pretty good user friendly app developer gotta work or widget improvements though other that than it gets the job done
4,very nice app how likely is is that you will implement achievements eg for streaks
4,i like the simplicity of this app very easy to use casually i especially like it doesnt require an online account like all the other data vacuums i would like to see cloud storage integration dropbox drive etc another thing that i would love which i hope others would agree is having a defer action on taskshabits to defer the item to next day i can edit the task and set the date as next daybut it would be a nice feature would pay extra on top of premium for these good work 
4,does what its supposed to one time charge for premium which is still pretty basic i wish there was a was to make the list view more compact visually hard to scan over the list also a custom order option would be great
4,good app but need more features for premium users 4 sure
4,very helpfull i use it often to track my studies and to make sure i take out and put in my retainer when i start getting a paycheck i plan on buying the full version
4,very nice app but i have a question regarding the premium version i have bought the premium version of this application so my question is that if i buy a new phone can i still use the premium version of this app on the new phone or do i have to buy it again on my new phone kind regards
4,those having trouble after closing app n not geting reminders and alarms the ans is go to ur mob settings and add habit now app to wonts sleep
4,its an amazing app can recurring habits have something like every 2nd monday of the month also how can i finish a habit 2x in the same day
4,its very helpful
4,its pretty good but for me its missing one feature most of my habits are to be done a certain number of times per week so it would be great to have a week view where you can see the ticks and crosses for each habit so far that week for all habits at the same time i know you can see them one at a time by clicking last 7 days but clicking on this for one habit closes this view for another then you can get a good overview of how much you have left to do that week
4,wow bt one thing make me pain  that is money
4,esta buena pero agregaría notificaciones forzadas que te obliguen a responder y una opción para universitarios y armar un calendario solo con materias
4,great app very stable so far
4,i wish if i can mentor my progress in habits by points not only by days
4,if you add frequency graph and give custum modification of periods like week month year to histograph and give a frequency patch table then it is more better and attractive
4,love to use
4,beautifully designed lacks the option to make tasks recurring which would be very helpful
4,absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to habitnow  some other useful features  add a length to a task or habit  be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day
4,just using the free version has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book im reading i like
4,ufff me ayuda demasiado xq soy de las personas q se olvidan las cosas y esta app es la unica q encontre q tenia alarma
4,good app i just wish their was a way to add a morning routine with subtasks or sub habits also i wish you could order your habitstasks however you want drag and drop style
4,i got this app to setup a schedule to work from home and its been good for that i just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day the widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen the app could do to look a bit more modern but all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late ie reminder set to 200pm notification arrives at 203pm etc developers
4,its good i wish i had different lists and could personalize the sound my alarms made each tine they went off
4,good application one of the best habit tracker applications available on play store should have more features like authentication by fingerprint scanner cloud storage easily accessible sticky notes daily the notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea  i would have definitely bought premium if it had cloud auto storage better functionality for keeping notes and fingerprint authentication
4,dashboard charts better be inclusive all habits not just per one habit also download to excel would be nice
4,helpful but needs a way to quickly customize the order of the goals currently the choices are alphabetical by priority etc but i would prefer a click and drag option to have them show up in the widget in the specific other i would like i had to go into each goal and add a specific time to each one too get them in the order i want even though i dont want to do them at a specific time
4,amazing app landed to this one after trying a few available looking to buy it with advanced features but one important suggestion the daily status graph it should include no of tasks planned and how many are completed as well along with habits addressed i will surely update it with additional star as it gets supported
4,does exactly what it says would be 5 stars if the categories could be customised
4,wish i could add more habits
4,useful and very nice apps i bought premium 5 stars when can backup with gdrive
4,really a fabulous app i have tried several of the habit tracking apps this is by far one of my favourite as it combines daily habit tasks with some ad hoc tasks for day to day life only one feature i miss in this app is the ability to select the snooze time ex whether i want to snooze for 1 hour or 1 day etc atleast some standard options currently it gives only 1 option apart from that its the best app
4,straight forward i like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day the scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule its also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not and the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent youve been with something and that will remind you to buckle down
4,hi i wouldve given this app 55 if i hadnt already spent so much time exploring it its so cumbersome as it is to check what i have scheduled for a day in the future i have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a monthview interface please make it more intuitive let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the pastfuture let me also edit taskshabits from a day in the future
4,i wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit i want in any order i want it lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way i need it also wish the conpleted habit or task would disaapear after i complete each day it either stays where it is or goes to bottom other than these i like it
4,great app with an ugly widget if the widget was cleaner id give 5 stars
4,almost perfect an option to export archived habits preferably to excel would be great
4,not bad if you want to install
4,love this
4,decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but i am unable to reschedule dates on the habits i have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
4,very good simple and easy to use i would like to see more statistics because for now i can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time but not a overall statistics
4,easy to use and the alarm works great
4,addition of day counter for negative habits will be great also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful and widget isnt working
4,what if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week i guess while adding a habit this app requires one to select 4 specific days just a suggestion it would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed
4,i love it only problem i found is that you cant edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance
4,have only used the app a little while not to bad for basic tasks to bad you cant do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version its an easy app to use
4,everything is good i bought the premium after 5 minutes used but one question why we cant create a task with a date which is the day before eg today is 11 may i cant create a task on date 10 may sometimes we might be overlooked or too busy to add task but we need to have a record of what we had done on the day it can make us feel so completed
4,i like this app as it is a simple way of tracking your habits however there are a couple of things i wish were improved 1 if i have updated all of my habits for the day the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them 2 i wish the analysis was a little better have some graphs visually showing progress also how about showing how i am doing on my habits as a whole not just the individuals for example if i have a day where i dont do any of my habits thx
4,have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium i love it but a few needed suggestions an option to make a task recurring and also maybe on one same habit have different times per day weekday weekend and i cant seem to edit which days for habits after the initial setup i also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do maybe a swipe would be nicer
4,please create desktop app
4,i really love the setup of this app i wish it had the ability to see weekly progress in a bullet journal style that would make it perfect for me
4,nice app very good ic k zariye se hm apna roz mara ka kam time pe kr skty hein apni adaat pr qabu pa skty hain or kam ko yad se kr skty hain kisi ka shikwa gilla b nai rehta bohat smjhdari se banaya gaya hai ye app nice application
4,the app is pretty good and i love the reminders however its kinda difficult to edit already made habits especially the number goals
4,easy to use great for creating new routines and habits
4,like the app either i havent found it or they dont have it in the free app but i would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day would be fun to see at the end of the month all that i did on one calendar
4,pretty good app matches description
4,nice app quick question can i add new categories when adding my habits im not see an option only the options that came with the app is available is it that everything else must go under other please advise
4,the app is perfect for people trying to get more organized its easy to use and i use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for
4,this is a very good app just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice
4,why theres no option to change schedule
4,its good but calendar view just dont make sense with the obligation to select a day to see its schedule which is not what id be looking for when in calendar view preferring much more to see in one look any day i havent done something or something like rate of habits successfully done
4,preaty nice but they could improuve the ui it took me some time to figure it out and i know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app
4,hesitant to buy premium i feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty im on a budget and if im spending 5 i certainly want more bang for my buck i wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price
4,i find the app amazing it is one of the best habit apps that ive used the only thing i dont like is that ive bought the premium but i dont feel like it was worth it the only thing that i really needed was to have more than 7 habits but the rest is just decoration it would be really nice if there is an overall progress page to check how am i doing in every habit instead of going through every single one of them another thing that would do this app just perfect would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer other than that i recommend to download it keep doing it so
4,great app very usable and straightforward but i wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging
4,wish you could set tasks to recur at regular times but its a good app overall
4,it is a great app but still there is space for some improvement the calendar for example you have one to add more tasks other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job but note one to see the sum of all tasks you should create a resume calendar where i can see the percentage of jobs that i accomplished in each day
4,easy simple cheerful effective
4,funciona bien pero si le hacen falta cosas tengo la versión premium resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría por ejemplo como sabemos existe categoría denominada study pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se hace
4,i like using the app and my weekly progress i would like to see a total of how many things i did each day and maybe a graph i like positive reinforcement
4,would be great to customize the alarm i want to test pavlov effect with supplements
4,habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature ive been looking for todo items that are automatically created at certain times as such it is the best such app ive ever used the only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items they just hang around cluttering the listthe best it does is move them to the bottom i find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed todo items certainly that shouldnt be the default but there it is
4,great at 1st
4,alarm not working at all i have checked all settings in my phone they all are on could you please assist me on same
4,love the app best of its kind imo not perfect but so close this app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks if i may suggest  having the 00 digits be optional and not by default when settingentering goals  having multiple remindernotification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day ex 200 push ups a day with 4 reminders so i can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits or the ability to group habits
4,great however marking down one star as cant find a way to edit frequency of habit once youve saved it have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency
4,não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa
4,i have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status so a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in habbit tracker app also a dynamic habbit counter could be added
4,nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits for example i want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day the app allows only one specific time for the reminder so please add the mentioned feature
4,i havent started using it officially but im giving a 4 star because the user interface is on point im starting my habits on monday hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the ui thank you
4,i looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest ive found to what i was looking for unless i missed howwhere to do them there are three things i wish i could do in the app first create custom categoriessubcategories especially under health second edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct three have the ability to add notes
4,so far i like the app question  i see a spot where it says notes for the month but how do i input notes i dont see the option to enter notes
4,hey awesome app it wasnt long until i purchased the unlocked version however some things could be improved for example you cant change units after the habit is created and it would be nice to hide the 0 part after digits since mostly it refers to minutes or iterations or cups and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as learn at least 300 minutes or drink at least 20 cups if the number is whole why not just hide that point zero  itll look neater i think
4,great app how can i change the alarm sound
4,awesome app  i like the daily work and habit tracking  thanks guys
4,helped me a lot
4,make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notificationsthe app works great and is super helpful the only thing i would recommend is to be able to make custom categories right now you can do other but cant specify would definitely recommend app update 2 i cant seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications i can get it to work but only once then it stops would you be able to help me out after my first review you said youd be able to if i needed it
4,i liked it i just have to many things i want to put in it and i cant afford to pay for premium
4,i like it its quite easy to use would it be possible to sync data between devices that would be a lovely plus
4,best productivity app ive found goal progress tracking hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better
4,just installed and trying out ill update along with my experiences uiux is pleasant and clear looks promising love the free fullfeatured  premium accessoryfeatures philosophy ill pay later on to support development issues 1 cant change startdate  repetition of a habit if itll break history data at least allow duplication 2 would expect scheduled days to be coloredmarked in the single habit calendar as future overview not just as achievement overview  so far good job
4,i liked it but once i got it i saw a had no need for it and i felt like i dont need it as much as others
4,simple and practical
4,this is a great app the ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome there are just 2 things id really like to see that would make this a 5star review for me 1 full editing options currently cant edit the frequency for my times per period items and 2 a helpglossary feature im not sure exactly what the link icon means as it is 0 on items ive not done or done once but 1 on items that ive done twice or three times
4,easy to add habits and tasks you see everything for that dat
4,it s great
4,i like this app but i dont understand why i cant set up tasks that repeat unless theyre habits or edit the categories a habit is something you want to always do i want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary
4,would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price seriously i have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode if i was going to pay im most certainly not paying now thats just too petty a thing however great concept guys
4,great simple app notifications can be better they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless
4,great app keeps me on track and efficient helps me stick to my new years goals just wish we could add more habits
4,all to do lists should embrace habit monitoring also i like it when a pending task persists on the list until its done or removed
4,set a color which depends on percentage for goals
4,very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks have already replaced my old task app for habitnow glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing ive been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits if these capabilities dont exist would love to see these as improvements
4,good enough
4,love it bought premium but needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like take mom shopping first sunday of every month at 11am
4,good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress
4,your app is awesome please add sticky notification
4,i love this app its the only one ive found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way however i do get frustrated that i cant seem to change the scheduling of a habit after ive set it up eg if its set for once a week and i want to make it twice i have to delete it and create a new one can you please fix this
4,its a good app i honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes as long as there are no ads im fine i just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen that would be so convenient
4,please add an option to update habittask status from the notification bar when i receive notification on the set time overall good app
4,its relatively helpful especially when checking habit progress however some notifications do not come on time but nevertheless i recommend it
4,great updates nice color nice experience pro version is better wished more was free need quick add tasks see tick tick needs folders and a pomo timer would be awesomethanks for adding sort and categories
4,it is a good for organising daily task n making habit
4,i like this app alot it lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way only would ask a few minor things like a line on the bar chart that shows the limitgoal  task alarms even when app not active
4,very nice but would you consider letting people create custom categories and setting intervals such as every 2 days instead of number of times a week with that this app would be perfect
4,another important feature missing is the ability to tell if i have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar currently the calander view shows days in a circle please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day this is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on on top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task that is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one
4,handy habit helper
4,just installed this app it is easy to use and is quite beautiful i would love to have a vision board feature page that i can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature spiritual before jumping to premium please
4,good app wish there were more customization
4,very nice ui but need some work 1 first week day mondaysunday option in calendar 2 calendar should show taskshabits below calendar instead of when touching the selected day only this makes you feel you have nothing the whole daymont add this and app will be more solid and i may jump into premium keep it up
4,i subscribed for premium because i feel its nice could you tell me where to check the status report and how to reorganize the habits freely without any sorting order thanks edit please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average
4,only used for a day but its the best app ive found for daily tasks  to do lists would love to see the following 1 completed tasks move to the bottom 2 tasks be linked to a numerical value 3 the ability to order each item manually daily
4,love it it works i would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didnt work so i had to do them all over again overall love it though
4,thank you for responding and im looking forward to that update customized categories another improvement id love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one such as save 100 per week etc i got the premium and love the dark theme this app is the best ive found for my needs thank you
4,great app could be better if i could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times thanks
4,very useful reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version thank you
4,this app is really functional and helpful the widget is great caveat you can only track seven habits without paying its one time five bucks and worth it though suggestion to the developer make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we havent done yet more easily
4,this is actually a really good app i just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1 to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2 a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying
4,so close to being the perfect app 2 things needed before i switch to using it 1 add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days sometimes i dont have time or forget to update my habits on the day of 2 ability to set first day of week for calendar i prefer monday
4,quite a good app for me
4,i really like this app so far its flexible ans very customizable the only thing i would add is either more categoriesthe ability to add my own health and home are very broad categories so being able to have sub categories would be nice
5,this helped to fix my life
5,its goodwhen i install iti have many plans every day thanks for your program
5,a really nice and amazing app lots of flexibility even in the free version love it so far
5,very nice app i downloaded many app but it is the best app i love this app thanks for this app  i love this app
5,almost perfect theres only one feature id like it to have that it doesnt modify start of the week to europeans it makes absolutely no sense to start the week on a sunday which throws off my quantifications i bought premium but will update my review if this is added edit  it worked thanks
5,actually we need two type of tools one for long term growth good habits and short term  to do list this aap fullfil both the purpose
5,nice app i love it
5,i love this app so much 5 starts definitely i just got the app and i love it but there is only one thing i really want a different background on the app but for that i need premium i dont think thats fare but 5 stars love it
5,i love this app this app is just right for me
5,perfect for my needs of tracking goals
5,absolutely love this app it is so simple to use and it will remind you of everything  i would recommend this app to anyone
5,helps to create new habit love it
5,good app this guys are cool
5,litt it helps a lot
5,easy to use and organize yourself i love the habit feature to help you train yourself into healthy habits
5,best app keep it up 
5,one of my biggest problem i was not so persistent and regular also i always tend to forget task habit tracking task tracking and reminder helped me its like a part of myself changed that day when i decided to install it its worth purchasing premium version i really love the widget on my home screen winners secret of success is always hidden in their daily routine so this app is highly recommend from my side a request to developer team please dont stop or turn down this app ever
5,this is the app that i kept from numerous time management apps all are full of features but not practical this app serves me clear cut habit  task simple and most practical  but i cant set the ending reminder alarms for a habit i can only start but we need a alarm that tell us to stop 
5,fantastic this app is visually appealing easy to use and is exceptionally customizable with notifications and reminders i love the ability to categorize desired habits and set their importance the only limiting factor is that it seems to be a little more designed for people with a standard work schedule ive suggested adding a feature that would help for those with a changing work schedule
5,super useful and easy to sort out
5,an awesome app i strongly recommend you to install it and use it has banch of advantages including pin
5,terrific for reminders and tracking enjoying this app
5,easy to use works greati downloaded it yesterday  pretty much what i was looking forwhich was more a keep my schedule track my scheduleremind me to drink water you can add to do thingsbut i do have a separate app for daily weekly months goalsbut on this app i remind myself to look at it lol
5,this app really helped me organize my life
5,life changing app
5,i rarely pay for anything on mobile because i dont trust most of them to be consistantly good but this one is different after starting with the trial i found it was good enough to be worth the risk and i have not been dissapointed it is a very useful and easy to use app and the devs are really responsive and on top of things as well
5,excellent interface easy to use
5,the best app for building habits anyone can have for free is this loved your efforts to think what is needed to the customers highly recommend this to anyone who wanna stay motivated
5,this is the best app i am being used i will never change it i started to use 1 year ago and i did not complain of anything

5,great app instantly bought premium would it be possible to scale the widget or make a new one thats fits a small 1x1 size i replaced my previous habit tracker with this app and i really miss that feature im sure it will help others too keep up the good work
5,i struggle with starting any new habits this was instrumental in even beginning a new habit super easy to set up i get reminders theres nightly accountability to check off the daily habits i purchased the premium as i decided i wanted more than 7 new habits
5,excellent lovely and really helpfull thanks
5,it is an amazing app and very easy to use it sends me notifications so i can keep my progress every single time i look at the app it motivates me to complete all tasks and habits trust me you will love ticking those boxes after a task is done amazing satisfaction definitely would recommend
5,love it customizable so you can track progress or just be reminded to do something
5,exactly what i was looking for an app that i can quickly open hit the  button and jot down a task thats on my mind and can add a reminder for that bill thats due next week i tried evernote and its was too complicated this is exactly what i need thank you

5,this app exactly suits my needs i searched an app that allows me to record unsuccessful attempts rather than just successful ones this app can also set alarms as a reminder that have helped me actually do the task which otherwise wouldnt be completed the analysis of habits suits my needs highly recommended ultimately building habits is just finding an app that suits your needs  getting started happy that i found one for myself
5,thats what i was looking for 
5,enjoy the app
5,so far this is working well
5,premium user easy to use very useful thank you habitnow  few suggestions cum requests  a please make this app eligible for google family library for premium users b show percentage in charts c charts can be improved graphs can be added d many features but still few more can be added e reply to mails earliar
5,great no ads funtional app
5,i like using the app but im not able to see previous month bar graphs is it happening only for me
5,nice p
5,i had this on my old phone before it broke and i tried at least 10 other apps similar to this and they never measured up i would absolutely recommend to anyone who needs to organize theiar thoughts its visually good easy to use and super helpful
5,i really like this app i purchsed it forever 
5,well organised and and loving it
5,amazing app if you have a habit you need to seriously quit or start it will send you reminders on a time you like multiple times a day great app
5,i love it palling of going pro
5,great app 5 stars for sure what would make it even better from my pov  an option to set recurring tasks eg i want to pay my bills every month on the 1st and i want to add a single recurring task new habit has the option how often do you want to do it but new task does not  an are you sure question before deleting or undo option after  the option to filter the list of tasks by category especially if you also use it for work tasks like i do
5,does exactly what it should do gives you zero bs helped me create purpose and structure during quarantine so that i dont go crazy
5,really great app tried a few and this is certainly the best one ive used
5,im really enjoying this app but i wish it had the following more view color and size options analytics on all habits done in the course of a week or month and better widgets the text is so small in the widget and the texts for the habits in the app doesnt stand out oh and setting rewards for completing habits would be really cool a rewards earned section that you check off once you use the reward like buy yourself an ice cream
5,this app is great for creating new habits by time of day day of week location etc run 3x per week take blood pressure daily when at home etc works as a task list but is better as a habit creator
5,perfect app highly recommend to stay organized 
5,i regularly used this app n it help me to track my habbit n encourage me to be better n better task is always challange for me n with the help of this app i complete my task without forgotten or take it seriously so it change my life n somewhat my life is regular with this app thanks habitnow

5,very nice interface we can track our to dos for the day and habits that we want to develop fair pricing less in size so even simple phones can have
5,nice but its really irritating that you cant edit frequency or a start date but i could live with that unfortunately when your schedule  circumstances change you have to create a new habit because you cant change days and frequency edit issue fixed thanks guys

5,the app is super legit  please make possible to decide the order in which the comments appear under the calendar in the habits section i have a comment of 8420 followed by a comment of 7520 followed by 8520 is impossible to have comments organized chronologically thanks for the amazing app d
5,it is so good app i like it so much
5,seems pretty good so far
5,a very good app  it helps me to manage my online classes and daily routine together 
5,tried many habit tracking apps this one keeps it simple while maintaining primary functionalities that is expected from a habit tracker no need for other day planner apps
5,really cool app
5,super clean customizable easy to use scheduling app you can make it super simple or go in depth with pie charts and bar graphs i love it and its helping me start new habits i love recording things but always give up because it takes too much effort long term but the scheduled notifications remind me to log daily before i forget no complaints from me i highly recommend giving it a try

5,extremely helpful and easy to use
5,im so happy with this app
5,it worked perfectly for me and benefits me with fantastic pleasures
5,ive never rated something on google play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something this is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way it allows you to view the progress youre making with habits and it gives you the most functionality without having to pay anything other apps give little functionality before you have to pay
5,love it the app i have been looking for
5,loved it easy tracking detailed statistics thank you for this 
5,premium version is awesome must use app to develop self discipline and to track your activities good stats window and satisfying ui
5,cute and functional little organisation app used the free version for a couple of months liked it transitioned to premium  its a oneoff payment for a lifetime subscription thought it was worth it clean design good system heres what i think would make the app even better 1 setting a duration for tasks not just habits 2 being able to move untimed tasks up and down the list 3 more task icons these are just things i would like ideally  love the app regardless
5,love that i can create a habit once click on everyday and it shows up everyday the best part is i have a habit thats has to be done every 15 days and this app allows me to pick how many days between i want this habit to occur best app yet
5,super duper amazing app  exactly what i wanted

5,highly recommended  its really working well
5,i love this app because its really useful for planning
5,i love this app its everything i needed i use it to manage everything including taking my medications paying for premium was totally worth it especially since its only a one time fee
5,best habit app it not only make habits become rontine it has a task option many do not have no need for two apps
5,love it the answer of my hope thank you habitnow 
5,it is a very fantastic app and it reminds me to do studies and do my homework
5,i love this app its like my own pocketpa i make notes on habits and when i go back to view theyre not in chronological order theyre ordering by the day of the month regardless of what the month is ddmmyy eg 03072020 then 04032020 then 05062020 id change it to ymd but cant see how to ill give 5 stars anyway because it is a great app despite this minor but annoying glitch is there any way to edit the habits such as to change the days i cant find a way to do that
5,nice application it was really very useful i did my work on time i was so much free time so thats good news i love it illi give u guys 5  stars i want another to do app it must have talking alarm and please reply me thanks for the very very very very very very very very very very very nice app bye
5,супер

5,great app very easy to use calendar view is amazing
5,very easy to use 
5,everything i needed in one app
5,love it  just need to increase habits option
5,it is a really useful app
5,this app is exactly what i was looking for you can have tasks repeat daily weekly monthly every three days every tuesday and thursday etc you can also add onetime tasks that will show up every day on your checklist until you complete it this has made my daily life so much easier and keeps me from forgetting to do important things my one suggestion to make the app better would be the ability to drag and drop tasks and habits into a specific order besides that it is great 
5,my life seems to be taking a roadless travelled i love it
5,wow this is what i was exactly looking for bought premium on the first day add many more features in the coming updates
5,simple to use
5,its a wonderful app  good for setting reminders but i want already made plan feature  that will be nice otherwise its a nice offline app

5,nice app for daily activities
5,love the app only had for 2 days 
5,just what i needed in a habit tracker simply amazing only request i have is can we have inbuilt timer for some habits like if i want a track a habit of daily reading a book for 30 minutes i want to see if i am reading for 30 minutes or less thanks
5,it enurages me to hat want to do in order to develop good healthy habits
1,requires an ms account
1,unable to get notifications setting events and not getting notifications what a waste of time
1,no calendar view
1,phone is 6 months old this app along with outlook office and teams really drained the battery
1,doesnt work with non microsoft email address
1,very worst as compared to google calendar i think google calendar and your this apps to be put it in the litter bins
1,i miss wunderlist with comment and now to do deleted comment function and now be silent apps 
1,to see the steps for a task it always requires to open up the task i want to see all the task with all the steps at a glance it would be nice if dropdown list of steps is available on tasks also on the widgets
1,slow less friendly wunderlist was far better app which you bought and killed i am not liking it and finally uninstalling after tolerating it for 8 months
1,what more can i say had to change my password cause i forgot and it asks me to change my password again due to questionable activity dont want to deal with it anymore its just a darn list who gives a rats behind if someone wants to b view what im picking up for dinner they can pick it up for me if they want but not trying to come up with a whole new password so you can make me create another one 10 minutes later
1,i cant synchronize my to do list with my devices
1,i have to loginsignup to use it i dont want to make any kind of account
1,i cant use my old email on my laptop and use a current email on the laptop the app will not let me use my current email and password
1,bad sync unneeded move from wunderlist unattractive graphics
1,in the last update the auto update for lists across multiple devices stopped working
1,very pointlessnot like notion you need to really improve on the appatleast google keep is a little betterbecause you can have side checkboxes notion can have habit checkers and moreplease improve on alot of featuressorry if i turned out to be disrespectful
1,dud
1,garbage takes a simple concept and turns in to a spam generator
1,after a few weeks the android app has stopped syncing with the windows app useless
1,didnt have a good experience sorry
1,missing lots of features predefined reminder datestimes suggestion must be editable
1,dont know why but this app just doesnt work tried adding a task just 5 minutes from current time and it doesnt work well only some times it doeswork totally disappointed with this being from microsoft my expectations were high
1,stupid app keeps kicking me out of my account
1,no notification when i will the app then it will remind me
1,its just opening pages forever out lighting images why
1,not syncing properly with office online
1,the widgets dont update only if i delete them every day and put them back but in your case they dont update by themselves
1,worked good but then it just kicked me out of the app
1,it is not giving me a reminder as a notification on my notification bar it is also not giving me any notification in the form of sound or vibration
1,sharing does not work in any way for basic todo its ok sharing its absolute trash if you share a list with somebody and that somebody addicts and item or creates an item you dont see any changes the person that you share a list with only sees an initial review of your list however no changes are propagated between the owner and sharing destination and what is even worse is if the sharing destination user updates any tasks that task disappear from the to do list that means items disappear
1,wunderlist was a wonderful piece of software that initially continued to work well after being acquired by microsoft the conversion to todo was ok some lost features but initially seemed ok the android and desktop app no longer consistently sync and lately the app consistently loses my repeating tasks they simply disappear upon completion completed recurring tasks still display on my day and recurring tasks also lately weirdly create duplicate tasks when repeating todo isnt even close to wunderlist unfortunately so time to move on
1,wunderlist was a great app and never failed our family now that ms has taken over its riddled with bugs lists dont sync lists cant be shared etc such a shame this used to be one of my most important apps
1,i like to keep my calendar simple for me i color code my appts i dont need time slots id love to find a better app than this one
1,1 star for not letting me to try the app without signing in
1,decided to stop using it as i have to add lists manually to my day page every planned tasks doesnt automatically listed on my day page every other apps doesnt need to do that time wasting thing of manually adding the lists
1,cant print after last update
1,does not work nice interface but faulty doesnt work
1,tried to log in put my email and psw and only shows loading ive waited 5 minutes in this screen and nothing happens
1,i loved when first saw itbut the problems it has is very bad it does not properly sync i wrote down many things and then opened in my laptop nothing was there although i clicked sync and connected to internet properly still the tasks were not synced to my laptop also another disappointing thing is that the remainder doesnt make any sound it just pops up silently and unnoticeably in the notification bar so totally useless
1,sync dont work cant invite directly and  every programmer in this world can do better than this wunderlist was a great app im very sorry for what happened to it
1,login taking so much time
1,no dark mode for widget
1,whenever tried to login it says their is some problem try after sometime advise do not waste ur date on this app
1,not ready for prime time
1,would have given this app 5 stars but for 3 issues 1 the notes icon keeps appearing next to reminders 2 the tasks do not appear in order of time but alphabetically this is really annoying 3 the tasks do not appear on the calender which is also really annoying
1,the daily reminder for any task only works if the task is tapped completed either through notification completedsnooze or through app even if the task is actually not completed  if you swipe the notification without tapping on completed the daily reminder stops this is funny the daily reminder should continue daily whether the task for a particular day is completed or not completed
1,i hate that note symbol showing up on tasks even i didnt put any notes and that makes me go crazy because i have to open each and every task to see that i have put notes it worked fine when i downloaded it please fix it it really annoying
1,the perfect sample of how a well working app wunderlist was totally spoiled when a group list is created it does not sync the list between users so it does not work for group lists when problem was reported to support i received an automated response by someone who doesnt understand english and was trying to convince me that i dont have a problem rather then trying to help
1,this is the only microsoft app with no support for proper status bar and navigation bar colouring and transparency the devs working on this app are lazy af and whats with that sad attempt at a widget its hideous
1,granted i just downloaded the app but i have yet to find anything useful about it copypasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour seriously no drag and drop and i havent been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else if i cant share the task list why is there an assigned to me toggle instructions on the ms website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one i have utterly useless and frustrating
1,almost perfect if you could make option so tasks tabs can be little smaller that is more compact it would be perfect app it would save screen space and fit more tabs on screen
1,all tasks now appear with a note icon even if there is no note there completely unreliable with the reminders of repeated tasks sometimes the remind me at goes blank for no apparent reason check the task after midnight of its due date and you wont get reminded of this task the next day the app either forgets remind me or repeat part after one cycle of task done
1,why suggest tomorrow option in widget
1,ok sorry i am not sure whether you are serious or deliberately misunderstanding me wunderlist could share lists with people inside my organisation ie colleagues or outside my organisation ie family it seems todo can only share lists with people that are within my domain and have a microsoft account will this ever be changed please see the thousands of requests for this feature on many forums i cannot believe you actually misunderstand this request
1,i cant create an account
1,pants
1,notes sign is in all notes all over the internet yet microsoft not fixing what does it take to fix the bug it has been a month that we have been reporting this
1,terrible im sure im not the only one saying this but ill add mine it used to be a great app as wunderlist but is now terrible i can only assume its intentional to force people elsewhere because theres some money to be made an added recent quirk is it doubling any hylerlink in the notes whenever you close the keyboard  a more insane quirk i couldnt dream up dont bother
1,updated i used to have this rated 4 stars until the most recent update which has issues with website addresses now every time you go into a note with a web address it doubles it each time you write anything and exit previous 4 star review i was an hugh supporter of listmaster but they went out of business this app does even more except i would like to see some type of an import  export feature using csv files for file backup
1,horrible app requires a full microsoft account to use and when you try and log in itll link every one of ms accounts from history ended up deleting everything todo my ms account etc microsoft are truly a terrible company when it comes to accounts it was in 2000 and it still is 20 years on
1,update made it so that every entry has a note attached and doesnt have the ability to actually edit the note on android doesnt happen on the pc version of the app
1,multiple bugs in the andriod and windows versions no one responds to the uservoice and helpshift bug posts seems like microsoft has not invested properly in the dev team
1,it was working great until a few days later i opened my phone one day to see if i have any activities to dosubmit today but it says that i have to sign in to my account but u never signed it off and when i try to sign back in it never lets me sign back in no matter how much or what i method i try to sign in and recover my account i am really disappointed i shouldnt even be giving it one star thats how disappointed i am but since this wont let post my review without a rating
1,lowered the score after seeing no highly needed feature updates after 8 months had to switch from wunderlist to do still lacks functions which make wunderlist so great importing worked well but sharing previously shared lists required me to make a new personal account  this wasnt an issue before all is set up now and the app still feels limited still most of all why switch why not just rename wunderlist to say microsoft wunderlist
1,does not respect privacy i miss good old days of wunderlist
1,everytime ask for log in and says log in server issues whereas other apps works best offline and no need of log in
1,forced on us as wonderlist was stolen
1,microsoft is trash they removed the full screen editing option now its just another useless note app i wont use
1,would be 5 stars but does not have option for recurrence due dates for more than today is not working there is no shame also in adding nice and convenient calendar options from outlook or microsofts other software options
1,this app was perfectly fine before microsoft got its hands on it i used it for years for pretty much everything it was perfect now i cant share lists with people unless they are in my organization lists dont sync or just hang whenever i try to force it to sync people dont receive my requests within a list this app is now a complete waste of space on my phone and after years of wanderlist i am now forced to try find a new app
1,i miss wunderlist it was much better
1,anybody who selected 5 starts clearly did not ever use wunderlist but it is impossible not to make the comparison consideration for a review this company plays foul you buy out an excellent competitor for this app you are pushing and then rather than improve on it you produce something unquestionably inferior dastardly deed and regardless of your improvements there are others out there ill choose you wont get my support full stop 1 i cant add a task and have it emailed to the team member they have to keep checking todo all during the day wasting time 2 we lost the crucial comments section this allowed a team member to provide a status update or send a query this had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task it allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback now we have to go to a different app like email or whatsapp to respond 3 cant sort the tasks according to team member so i gotta scroll and scroll to find all tasks i gotta talk to a team member about theres more but out of words
1,ms again acquired and destroyed a good product wunderlist use to use wunderlist a lot once wunderlist bought by microsoft wunderlist user was forced to migrate there is a sharp decline on how often i use the app now the widget works poorly from time to time there are signin problem 
1,sign up and login does not work
1,the stopped working the next day i downloaded it and got signed out and when i tried signing init said problem with my account duh
1,bargin bin wunderlist we had and enjoyed wunderlist for years microsoft bought it and we were migrated over with the assurance it was justvas good nope it sucks tasks assigned on the same list due the same day with the same reminder settings dont show up on a master listv of tasks on to the next one
1,crashes suddenly
1,task completed and ticked but it didnt disappear when i log in the next time this made me done the task twice which incurred severe loss to me this happened for many times and the error are not solved i do not recommend this to do apps
1,bring back wunderlist you cowardly knaves
1,edit originally 35 because it is a nice app with one major flaw microsoft commented on my original review saying to contact customer service via email i did and they told me to look at one setting but my phone doesnt have that setting they responded back basically o well thats all we got and said its my phones fault like really piss poor support especially considering the app works fine for an extended period but then will stop cant be the setting they recommended
1,the app is useless took all my tasks and now denied me access  forcing me to sign create a microsoft account
1,you are not letting us synchronize with any 3rdparty calendars it is not easy to add any other people to tasks or checklists either stupid java and python worthless
1,wont let me sign in with my microsoft account ive clicked create a new one as well and it tells me the domain im trying to use is reserved like i know i was trying to sign in with it uninstalling
1,brilliant app bad for dyslexia irlen syndrome accessibility  white colour in task boxes please remove or give option to change the white colour fill in task boxes even if the white task boxes are grey would be better  but ideally option to change colour fill white background and black text is terrible for accessibility  dyslexia irlen syndrome eye strain and migraines im desperate to use this app and love the coloured page background but the white task boxes fill the screen
1,if i edit something in the note then pressed back button it will save without confirmation dialog  will lost those words if it happened by accident
1,it was a huge thing i lost my data along with my account
1,why do i need an account for do to list
1,bring back wunderlist inconsistencies with being able to assign users to list some lists not identifying users who have already been added and are active on the list
1,hi team how you can make the worst application ever from microsoft great go ahead and make this kind of application only
1,terrible
1,crashed and burned since last update i have lost my to do list cannot load it have lost all my christmas present shopping list the air is blue _734 please return it to how it was
1,this app keeps constantly writes up to an ssd for no reason by megabytes per sec be careful its dangerous for your hardware
1,undo option not in app and bin by mistake delete task folder and it is not recovered now
1,love how you can set one off reminders and reoccurring tasks this allows me to combine my daily routine with the tasks i need to do all in one place however there is no way to see your daily tasks in chronological order automatically the my day section requires you to manually add all tasks despite any due dates the today section in planned area sorts each day alphabetically so you dont know which task is due first or when as doesnt show issue in both android andd windows
1,keeps blocking me every time change passwordvery frustrating
1,why am i only allowed to be signed into one device at a time and need to go through the process of signing in every single time i try to check it or add something on another device
1,ive been trying to get start the app but it is not working at allpopping the same temporary problem on screenis it really a helpful app
1,microsoft bought an already mature application spent 4 years working on it and this is all they have to show for it perhaps they need more than 2 high school students to support this product poor integration with outlook most of the outlook tasks fields are not visible in to do so you cant see the task details when using to do to do task notes sub tasks are not synced with outlook tasks so you cant see your to do task details when you are in outlook look elsewhere
1,doesnt have comments as wunderlist does
1,what the hell wrong with youhow many will you take recover the accountgo to hellyou clumsy
1,i still feel this app has ruined wunderlist after using wunderlist for so many years and this todo has so many bugs
1,why do i have to sign in again even tho i did not even log out in the first place it is very inconvenient for a to do list
1,appalling product
1,repeat reminders dont show notifications once youve completed it if you set a weekly reminder to take your trash down to the road once you get the first notification and complete it it doesnt notify you the next week this app is broken fix it
1,so boring 
1,i miss wunderlists aggregated notifications
1,you have to create a microsoft account to use the app
1,to hard to signin make it easier to sign in i wasnt able to sign in or use the app uninstalled
1,so there are lot of bugs if i do not mark reminder as completed then it goes away from the notifications when the date changes its a daily reminder so i dont get notification next day as well untill i open app and mark that reminder as completed
1,standard above average
1,the app is easy to use and is very effective i never experienced any technical failure or downtime
1,registration is required
1,why isnt monday the start of the week
1,it wors fine on my phone but its terrible on my desktop not all my sub information on a tab is showing this is the united states you should not be able to put a product out if it doesnt work properly you think because were not paying for these apps you can just put anything out 
1,long time fan and user of wunderlist switched to do last year before the app was fully shut down and been mostly happy until last week when to do started deleting tasks
1,does not sync flagged emails i can see it online but not on the mobile app
1,terrible experience with this my lists transferred from wunderlist which never caused me any problems and now to do keeps losing my lists so i have to reinstall all the time sort it out or im using another app
1,garbage find something else if you need to share lists with someone else
1,does not synchronise between devices or users
1,tasks that i want them to be daily should appear on my day spontaneously im tired of adding them every time
1,cant get it to make a sound when some one adds a something
1,doesnt work in miui 12
1,um lixo esses caras da microsoft extinguiram o wunderlist que era mais simples e mais amigável que este lixo e ainda impediram a revenda do wunderlist para is antigos donos desidratando este traste de app perdi todas as minhas tarefas na transição vtnc microsoft
1,не приходят уведомления несколько устройств на разных платформах  одна и та же проблема сервис просто не работает
1,very bad app what i think but this app is wrost
1,since cortana is going away on my phone and invoke speakers going to move onto another one supported by smart speakers
1,whatever i do i wont get reminders set by me on this app i migrated from wanderlist the import of the data was very smooth but not able to use the basic feature of reminders  notification on my android phone
1,wont sync with my computer despite repeated attempts i miss wunderlist
1,would be great if i could receive notifications confirmed i have notification on but still wont receive them which makes app useless do not download until they fix this issue which is widespread
1,why am i being logged out of the application after every one day it is so annoying now even when putting the right the password message pops up saying something wrong with the microsoft account any explanation it is so sad to see a company like microsoft cant provide a well functional service disappointed
1,not sure why this is not available to an individuals office account we pad it just the business or school account did
1,нет авторизации через google
1,reminder and snooze notification arrives only when i unlock the phone useless
1,logs me out without notice
1,works only with a microsoft account
1,why am i not getting any notification none at all i even checked the notification settings
1,you have to use an account
1,find good app buy good app copy some features from it ignore all others new app doesnt do half of what the old app does kill the old app to make people use new app people move to other third party app 1010 development strategy well done microsoft
1,cannot use without logging in to microsoft account
1,widget forces my day list my day is frustrating and useless wanderlist both the app and widget were amazing and youve totally screwed it up give us back what actually worked please
1,you should add time parameter also means if i pointed out important work of day but in important work what time i should assign and when to do should also be visible below that work not in the form of symbol but in the form of time and data get arranged according to time
1,i got this because you cant set voice reminders in cortana anymore but you cant set them in this app either confusing layout and doesnt have the functionality of a personal assistant trash
1,not as good as its predecessor wunderlist but serviceable needs integration with outlook flagged messages should appear in tasks and dated tasks should appear in outlooks calendar come on guys this is basic stuff
1,doesnt sync with my wife essentially as useful as notepad wanderlist was a significantly better app
1,useless since i cant put exact time for a deadline
1,needs a lot of improvement suggestion or feedback shared is waste as no one replies
1,worst reminder app ever big companies run by dumb people the app does not remind on time event after putting in the exact time dumbest people
1,im not able to login since last 3 months highly unsatisfied
1,microsoft killed a great app wunderlist by taking out the core functionality of integrating it with calendars
1,your favorite features are all in to do  blatant lie to do doesnt have email notifications like wunderlist for example upd 180520  and now reminders left accidentally or intended overnight are simply disappearing in the morning you wont see any to do reminders im really disappointed upd 190820  still without any improvements no email notifications and disappearing notifications after 0000 i wish i could rate zero star
1,bring back cortana
1,this app is fantastic excepti cannot manually rearrange my important list when that is updated i will come back to leave a 5 star review until then the app will always be lacking
1,coming from wunderlist i really tried to like microsoft todo but its horrible the layout is so full and depressing i hate the whole design colours choice of font amount of space wasted wunderlist was so much better my day is the most useless thing ever its cleared out each day so dont add anything when youre going to bed and want to plan tomorrow its all gone after midnight why wake something that worked so well for years and destroy it uninstalling this app
1,how do i only see tasks due for today i see that the my day tab has an option to add the days tasks is there a way to make this automatic sick of seeing tasks that are not for today but the next day or even weeks in the future just piled together also i have daily repeating tasks that when i complete todays task it gets replaced with tommorrows which makes it really hard to know if ive done todays when they look the exact same except for a tiny tommorrow at the bottom of the button helpp
1,shouldnt need to login
1,aak
1,you could just migrate the data from wunderlist and let me just log in with just an approval like how it works in other app migrations i already used the weird interface on my pc to migrate and now i cant log in from my phone i have all my data in wunderlist and i am forced to use this new nonsense app and additionally i have to do extra work as if i chose not to use wunderlist anymore because i found something much better you could at least take the burden of migration from users
1,sync not working despite of doing a manual sync from settings options the list are not getting updated even though i mark the task completed they are still falling under pending tasks please fix asap
1,not able to loginsay not login with personal accounti have only one microsoft account
1,in general this app works great but since it switched from wunderlist to todo it now logs out frequently and then the widget will no longer show your lists until you open the whole app again it happens every few days and across multiple phones please fix this
1,you have to pay and install another app outlook on another machine windows only pc to be able to undelete a list mistakes will be punished
1,wunderlist was so much better i cant find a way to delete the my day and tasks feature i just want lists
1,why do you have to sign in at microsoft account
1,its ok as a basic to do list if youre not interested in prioritising your tasks for the day you can set a due date but no time and you can sort by due date but theres no way of them sorting them into the order you want to do them in the day you can set a time on the reminder only ill stick to using ayoa where i can easily drag each item on my list into the order i want and much more besides
1,theres a simple app on playstore named to do list and it does what it says yours my god it is so terrible it cant even do a simple task for eg few tasks that i have set on repeat doesnt even show automatically in the my day tab i mean why not
1,many problems with this app
1,need an undo button
1,i cant use it for a month because email was wrong thats insane
1,i dont understand the idea of an account just give me an offline program
1,reminders dont work
1,worst app ever during the import from wonderlist it removed all of my data leave it to ms to screw up a great app
1,it doesnt run on oneplus 7t pro
1,seems alright so far but since theres not a single setting for notifications easy 1 star some lists im part of i dont want or need notifications every single time something is added add notification settings for a higher rating something that shouldnt even need to be asked for not fixed still plus widget doesnt update with restart stays blank on my day cant open it
1,voting 1 star because its the only way for developers to actually see this bug report the widget doesnt have the ding completion sound making it nearly worthless please fix
1,i miss wonder list to do sucks it is impossible to get anything entered without wanting to throwmy phone across the room dear microsoft screw yourself
1,completely unreliable i am a tech savy guy and i know my apps but damn microsofts software is degrading this app just skips certain reminders i miss events and tasks its nice to have everything on my pc as well but its unreliable this is probably the third micrsoft app i am uninstalling
1,i dont wanna log in with stupid micro acc
1,agree with other reviewers  wunderlist worked much better have issues with items not synching between devices takes a long time to manually synch uploading attachments to items doesnt seem to work without restarting the app the windows pc version is particularly poor appears microsoft have mucked around with the code base and broken a really good app 
1,its not wunderlist took a good app and ruined it just opened it up july 2020 no sync try later huh microsoft garbage
1,need be online every time start
1,switched over from wunderlist this app isnt as smooth to use and last night i put 2 things on my to do list with a reminder at 900am at 1000am i went into the app and that is when the reminders showed up in my notification bar previous reminders have also showed up with 2 hr delays dont rely on this app solely for important reminders
1,ms to do is practically useless restricting access solely to ms account holders severely limits any ability to coordinate taskspunch lists with non ms users ie customers collaborators vendors it is inconvenient and unnecessary to require the creation of a ms account in order to use an app that was previously available universally as wunderlist this restriction was intentionally added whos genius idea was this
1,inferior to wunderlist in every way sync works poorly planned smart list doesnt group by day which is very frustrating search function is poor
1,too bad app not working since the day i started using the apps again and again saying some prob occurred please check 8n browser
1,sign in not working
1,requires microsoft account deal breaker
1,very unreliable i have a daily recurring task it is synced between phone and desktop but the reminder doesnt fire on either platform
1,update after years and tons of my feedback reports on playstore ms feedback and twitter you still havent solve the main problem this app has background sync doesnt work are you kidding me the app has an awesome design but without background reminder sync is simply useless ive got a oneplus 6 but everything except this app work perfectly background sync for everything too so the problem is this useless app another awesome and clear from bug work microsoft well done
1,totally useless  sharing lists does not work
1,some reminders get missed and i dont know why mostly those that must repeat
1,i like the app but i have to give it one star now because the notifications stopped working after some recent update mi 9 miui 12 and the support doesnt answer my questions
1,why on earth would you create an app that doesnt link with your calendar the to do app is straightforward on android app and desktop version however theres no way to link it to microsoft 365 calendar its within the same suite of microsoft 365 and yet you cant schedule on either one to show up on the other thats asinine  you would think this would be a primary feature but the product manager must be sleep at the wheel its mystifying
2,app is okay but i am missing the categories also a view were i can group by category is missing
2,synching when it happens takes forever which means that when i make a change in one device i do not see those changes on my other devices for a long time if i see them at all
2,medium would be better if everyone had the feature to create todos from flagged email in outlook without that i dont need outlook on my phone
2,this app is good but the problem is reminders do not pop on the set date  time which destroys the purpose most of the time it doesnt pop at all so is the case with repeat apart from repeating daily monthly  yearly it would be appreciated if we had repeats for particular dates in a monthyear as not all tasks repeat in a fixed interval
2,i installed it in m laptop and it cant even launch the program continues to crash
2,i very beginning i can easily add by tasks list ie shopping list to home screen of my mobile but know this is not working please fix the issue
2,it doesnt gives a reminder of of my tasks and planned items at all
2,sadly microsoft have a history of replacing perfectly efficient apps with less efficient ones they have purchased and killed off the immensely popularwunderlist no doubt hoping they could transfer its users to their vastly inferior product i have just give it a third try out but todo is still a 2nd ratecamel of an implementation i have been using remember the milk which is fairly excellent but will move to aoya which may suit me better
2,it does not provide any notification even when a time is specified no notifications no alarms sometimes this drawback takes away the positive parts of this app
2,does job
2,update just lost my notes on my todo super annoying as it were important technical details also keeps having sync issues with my laptop subtasks do not synchronize old 3 star because the date on my phone does not show the weekday of a date like on desktop but this is something absolutely essential for me
2,theres no option to export my task list if i want to migrate to another app or just dump my task data into a csv im out of todo to avoid getting locked in google is less evil that way i can move out of its ecosystem any time i want and export all my data
2,la aplicación funciona bien pero el widget tiene algunos problemas cuando se cambia de pantalla o se abre otra aplicación este deja de funcionar y ya no permite abrir la app desde el widget tampoco permite cambiar entre listas cuando eso sucede
2,i had to switch from wunderlist and one of the most important features no longer existsthe ability to duplicate a list i have a couple long lists with sub tasks that needs to be replicated on a regular basis so this is a deal breaker for me
2,the effect of reminder is not seen what went wrong 
2,its okay works well for short lists but gets clunkier as lists get longer for example grocery lists become unbearable trying to list everything in aisle order takes ages to drag everything into place needs a way to keep groupings within lists
2,i really liked it when a list could have completed and uncompleted mixed alphabetically together now it is back like the much poorer wunderlist method with the two separated uncompleted at top completed at bottom much harder to reuse lists i have gone back to an earlier superior version sadly it wont sync with my wifes version of the app on iphone change it back
2,true amoled dark mode is needed amoledfully black pixels off not dark gray
2,since a few weeks theres a bug that adds a blank note to every item you add highly annoying as this makes actual notes no longer stand out was 5 stars before that bug though
2,great when it works however far too often it loses all my tasks and goes blank happened today on my android phone on aug 14th at 739 am bst can be fixed by uninstallingreinstalling but given regularity this is the 4th time in 6 months i suspect due to release cadence please sort this bug as i rely on this heavily update after a few months of glitch free use its happening again over past 34 days  this morning whilst synching support ticket raised with detailed steps
2,struggling with a new feature that suddenly appeared where if i post a task it comes with a sticker how do i remove this
2,i havent been receiving notifications for reminders set in task weekly core my day or nothing on my phone until i opened the app and the notifications started to appear please correct me if im wrong are push notifications only available when the app is open in the background 
2,app is great but there is no sound or alarm to remind you of tasks popup is not enough some kind of soundsongs is needed
2,widget not displaying todos properly
2,home screen widget doesnt load when the phone starts
2,loved it originally but cant stand the little page icons that clutter my lists now
2,when i modify the tasks online they dont automatically sync in the phone because of this problem i forget about a task i had to do it cant sync with google calendar for the rest its very well done and very nice
2,very basic tool missing many features like searches lists of overdue tasks reminders which really ring the alarm
2,need improve 1 add the option to use gmail for flagged task 2 incorporate a pomodoro option to do the tasks 3 improve the widget appearance
2,efficient
2,i need to manage blocks of time to schedule it
2,migrated from wunderlist because i had to and a feature i absolutely want and dont have is notifications of new tasks or completed tasks microsoft makes this feature available for personal accounts but not a team corporate one how stupid is that microsoft assumes work tasks dont require notifications too
2,deal breaker i can only set a due date and not an exact time ie i can only do jan 01 and not jan 01 at 12pm
2,every item shows a note now even without a note being entered
2,this app only notifies me of one reminder at a time so if i dont clear the notification it stops notifying me of other reminders it also doesnt allow scheduling more than 1 reminder for a task on a given day repeat doesnt help you cant duplicate a task to make a 2nd reminder either i have to make another task and manually copy and paste the name notes and date notification syncing is broken for me too i have to clear every reminder on both my computer and phone every time
2,assigning tasks to multiple users is missing which is very much needed wunder list looks much easy to work than this
2,was great but line breaks in notes section is making unusable please fix immediately or ill find another tool which would be a shame 
2,makes huge flawed assumptions on how you are using this the share menu forces you to add to my day by default which involves extra clicks to change no way to set default share to list no way to get rid of my day lost and other built in clutter lists
2,a shortcut icon within it to be placed for inviting this app to our colleagues friends to bring under a group thereafter he will take up in that particular group
2,whenever i sign it always show something went wrong plz sign in again this same problem occurs in other microsoft app also with me
2,i just went into my app and somehow everything was lost i had to import everything again from wunderlist but it was the old lists so i lost some really important info and im pissed
2,after the last update i can no longer get notification automatically i get notification only when i open the app please help resolve it it is a great app
2,the only reason i downloaded the app was for the completion sound  which doesnt exist for me 
2,не работают уведомления на повторяющихся задачах постоянно пропускаются задачи
2,sick and tired of suggestions being made by many of us in the forums and being ignored by you devs will use another app instead
2,planned apps dont show up un my day also sorting between future tasks todays tasks and previous unachieved ones easily gets confusing
2,asking for sign in frequently
2,i need dupplicate task function
2,hate having to sign in microsoft to use my to do list it was great when it was wunderlist
2,because i though that the teams are related to this app i downloaded but i was wrong
2,still handles only the most basic task repeat functions cannot handle the second sunday every x months or last day of the month scanarios interface is only soso does not show task times at a glance in main tasks screen
2,no more widget why 
2,the flagged email list has items in it that i ha e not flagged and also are not in my email account i guess your software has been hacked or has a problem all the emails are what i would call spam unwanted
2,exwunderlist user here widget goes to my day all the time and gets non responsive until you resize it or add it again this has been bugging me for months same issue on 3 different phones i used
2,reminders dont popup so i keep forgetting to do things unless your at a pc where i see outlook reminders anyway its pretty useless
2,crappy microsoft log in no matter what i did i could not log in i ended up downloading an older apk outside playstore with an older form of log in i successfully logged in with the old version and then updated the app through playstore the only reason i give 2 stars instead of 1 is that the app is great in every other way
2,sk aftar
2,why can i snooze only up to an hour where is a 4hour snooze option and 1day option i also cant sort tasks by reminder date most of my tasks dont have a due date but they have a reminder date i need to be able to sort by the remainder date
2,nothing more than a simple to do list without any decent widgets nobody wants to open the app every time they want to create a new task or check something they already did
2,although this is supposed to be an improvement on wunderlist you are unable so share lists unless a person has a microsoft office account or are in your network they dont allow it to be used for personal accounts
2,i miss the integration with cortana used to be able to talk while driving to add a task this requires too much hand interaction even simple apps like shopping list on android allow voice input
2,frequently reminds me on the wrong days of a reminder is set to monday wednesday and friday it will sometimes change to remind me on sunday instead of monday or thursday instead of wednesday would be nice to be able to swipe a reminder away and have it change to remind you at the next reminder time  instead of just cancel also if you have reminders listed in the notification area and android updates the app you lose the reminders and you have to manually find and rest them
2,please add todays task to my day automatically now it has to do it manually can you add calendar events in to do 
2,i kinda like it but i miss a lot of options few suggestions  more options on repeating task eg repeat every last friday add an alert for the person task is assigned to show tasks that has due date of today in my day have an option to let person the task is assigned to edit the task and option to choose your week start
2,prefer wunderlist this is a sad adaptation and should have never replaced an app that worked so well
2,look so simple but not its really confused to do i ever use how can i focused when i finised 1 thing for my daily routine and still there with schedule for different day
2,notification improper or null
2,it looks great but will not allow importing via a google software platform it works only for wunderlist  why wish we could use it
2,daily reminder doesnt work perfectly
2,why do you require accounts and passwords for a todo list app i just want an easy grocery list app and youve gone and made it difficult to use and added a bunch of unnecessary complications
2,fix the widget way too buggy unusable
2,why this so doesnt remind me
2,this app has a great ui and ux but theres one thing that really makes it useless id doesnt sync in the background so i add a tskl via desktop itll probably not show on my phone unless i open the app on my phone it makes the app risky if you need to count on your reminders another problem is the time suggestion when you create a task is always behind the keyboard and its hard to use it like that
2,it mixes todays completed task by tomorrow which is really bad experience and gives no happiness after completing a task todays completion must be removed and tomorrows list must be visible by tomorrow not today fix it
2,what is annoying about this app is a fact that android w10 web app have different functionality web i can colorcategorize tasks but its not available on w10android webandroid add new tasks on top option is available but its missing in w10 app another issue my widgets are empty almost every time i unlock my phone almost every time i have to launch app to get them working
2,keep having microsuck account issues and it takes me 20 minutes to sign in to the damn thing every time i tried to use it almost cost me my marriage i hate you ass holes
2,youd thing ms can come up with something better very basic you cant view tasks in your calendar you can specify task start and end time recurring tasks sometimes dont respawn properly
2,a bit too bare bones for me but i assume if you use your microsoft account for business a lot you may like this
2,microsoft youve made wunderlist worse where is the comments feature on each task that was a win for wunderlist and you just killed it
2,mostly ok needs option to disallow delete of notifications only when the notification is snoozed or marked as completed should the notification be cleared also once the notification is deleted there is no way to then go into the app and set a snooze time for the task to realert
2,great app but we should be able to customize list image from our device and customize notifications ringtone anyway it is a good app it would be great if you add this
2,big bug how can u miss this when we search by name it just searches the notes within the lists created it does search group names it doesnt search the list title it searches only the notes that are within the list how stupid is that
2,no because there is no recycle bin which is really uncomfortable and insecure so please add the recycle bin which will prevent me from accidentally deleting
2,cant sync i am unable to sync my phone account to pc account
2,cant choose notification tone has to share the sms tone which is confusing
2,horrible app im a big microsoft fan for their products but google keep is 100 times better
2,im disappointed having lost my data twice because there is a serious lacuna in its program when i delete a daily item after completing it it should go into the completed list and its next scheduled occurrence immediately appear in the current list but at times it doesnt happen like that and if ive deleted it from the completed list even after some hours it just disappears for ever seems that this action is serverdependent rather than being localized and on the mercy of internet
2,doesnt respect silent mode
2,repeated to do list do not appear on my day i missed few that option should have been there
2,ms has screwed up wunderlist the same as to skype so clunky and average poorly thought out should have just changed wunderlists logo and colour scheme the desktop version is slow 10s to respond you can be doing changes on the desktop and it get jammed up with app
2,as smart and skilled microsoft employees are this is a great app bu needs a lot of tweaks to be top notch you camt change the name of a list you create the completed or i should say deleted items in a list is stupid if i delete items they should be gone not kept in a completed list that just grows and no delete all button and or not even a choice in settings to either delete items forever without a completed list or to have a completed list that grows and grows single item delete is dumb
2,app is great for the people who forget their tasks i will be grateful if the company adds alarm reminders in this app
2,not easy to use and doesnt do a good job of keeping reminders
2,i guess once you get the instructions you realize that a calendar app preinstalled is more effective
2,como que eu configuro uma tarefa para ser realizada todas as terças e quartas se não é possível fazer isso adicionando apenas uma tarefa precisa melhorar urgentemente
2,desktop and web version is slow awkward and useless app for phone is good as soon as i have time i will switch to something else makes me miss wunderlist
2,love the app the synchronization with desktop and shared to do lists but this app is almost useless because the reminders dont create notifications if you havent opened the app for more than a day more than a dozen times ive checked and rechecked the android app optimization settings to ensure that android is not putting this app to sleep ive cleared cache data and uninstalled and reinstalled still this app will not reliably generate notifications
2,missing features from wunderlist might need to find a new app
2,much slower than wunderlist frequent issues with sync 20 seconds to sync after the website is already loaded between android phone and browser version
2,wont sync w my crew i have to cut and paste lists wunderlist was seemless
2,widget is horrible keeps switching to my day and wont allow me to change it really expected better from microsoft
2,sync between pc and android app is very slow wunderlist was better moving to google tasks now microsoft ruined a good thing
2,the app has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from microsoft to do directly in outlook it worked well in wunderlist but since wunderlist was transferred to microsoft to do it doesnt work anymore
2,good thing its free else who would pay as a fan of microsoft products the development of this app is disappointing its nothing but average if the developers can just pick the top task management apps in the play store and add their features into this todo app perhaps the development could be accelerated but right now its just like every other lowend todo apps available not robust not feature rich not exceptional
2,difficult login forces work or school address lost wunderlist lists as a result
2,wunderlist was better
2,does not store none tasks information well
2,great app but will have to uninstall if they dont sync with google calendar or include a calendar
2,bring back wunderlist this app has failed to link lists over and over we find ourselves trying to relink lists but it still doesnt work since this has changed from wunderlist its a huge disappointment find a better app also you cant silence it when someone is checking off a linked list when it does work super annoying i expected more from microsoft
2,nice interface and it syncs across my devices however the widget constantly crashes on both p30 pro oneplus 7t pro
2,widget misbehaves it keeps switching to my day and stops reacting to any taps when it does
2,thanks for ruining wunderlist you jackasses
2,romantic
2,cant sort via categories importance level doesnt sync well basically syncing problems all around creating new lists dont show in outlook proper
2,still have it as a temporary solution to keep my wunderlist todos but the laggy widget is the show stopper if youve got used to an almost instant wunderlist widget sync just forget about it most of the time you will need to sync manually
2,doesnt auto add to my day schedule wise repeat reminder doesnt work either
2,missing the widget for ios a todoreminder app is incomplete without a widget otherwise 5 stars
2,just like wunderlist except worse  laggy update of list from one device to any
2,i absolutely love this app  pc program to be able to keep constant notes between work then mobile in my pocket is fantastic until i discovered im not experiencing sync in real time so down to 2 star and my suggestion to get the app to 5stars would be if each input would automatically be visibly dated  if real time sync actually was real time needed vital info and thought i could just check the note on my smart phone but this has not been the case wasted a lot of my time  nothing
2,doesnt sync well with my laptop
2,desktop widget stops functioning every minute
2,when i went to create an account i would fill everything out and then i would have to start over couldnt even use the app
2,would be nice if theyd show you overdue tasks i missed quite a few tasks because i wasnt reminded leaving feedback is hard and annoying too many extra steps
2,widget continues to stop working nothing shows up until i resize it
2,widget has been broken with the latest update keeps reverting back to the my day view and then once it does that the button at the top left doesnt work anymore and so cant be switched to show other lists without removing the widget and recreating it please fix
2,this is by far the best todo app i gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use microsoft account for sharing the lists
2,find another app wunderlist was much better when you sort alphabetically then prioritize an item it doesnt move to the top of the list wunderlist would allow sorting and when it was starred move to the top
2,completely broken for synch wunderlist actually worked this is a disaster
2,doesnt allow you to sort completed tasks i have a single grocery list with 300 tasks in its completed section thats named by section using tags like produce  onions i used to be able to sort completed tasks alphabetically making it easy to have a running list where i could add back frequently purchased items now everything is lost automatically placed in completed tasks by completion chronology is a pain
2,forced to review to avoid popups every few days ok so far
2,when you create a task and then set a reminder you have to go back to the text and press enter otherwise it doesnt save it or even warn you if you navigate away caught me out a few times seriously annoying so looking at other options other than that its ok but nothing special and the views are a bit odd all for example doesnt actually show all tasks
2,why widget is not working
2,widget often becomes empty after restarting of launcher for instance i have to open the app to make widget work note 10  apex launcher tab s6  samsung home launcher
2,impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist thank you for screwing my wunderlists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password
2,i m facing the i same issue which kenners79below comment on 962020 is facing widget issue
2,this app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen they have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists might as well just use onenote now at lest that is used on my pc too
2,ui is good easy to use the only thing that bother me is that the reminder didnt work thats the basic and important feature of to do app missed many task because of this please fix it
2,apps widget still doesnt react correctly to dark mode changes i cant see the list often
2,too complicated
2,the text on the notes always gets messy specifically if you have spaces in between paragraphs or using links always gets messed up sentences move up and delete the first letters of the paragraphs really annoying
2,this is based on wunderlist which microsoft bought a few years ago they added some nice touches and ate listening to users suggestions but it is still a work in progress they removed too much of what made wunderlist good it integrates well with outlook though for now its useless for anything but the simplest task management
2,very good application  only i facing issues is  its wont work for offline 
2,in general the app is confusing repeating tasks work for some time and then stop working i have not found any clear logic behind this the same problem was with wunderlist not recommended
2,used to be great now its awful i use the widget the most and have it set to important to see all my tasks not just 1 or 2 per day unfortunately the widget reverts to my day every time i boot up my phone and wont switch back i have to remove the widget from my home screen then readd it  switch list to important  every day today was the 5th day of doing this and i got fed up so switched to google tasks which is now a much better app than it used to be  better than to do
2,needs a built in timer and some stats to make it the best productivity todo out there for now its just a generic todo with folders hoping it gets an update with those features soon as i do love the design and other microsoft products for now im forced to use another todo manager 
2,widget never loads making it nigh unusable in the way i used wunderlist prior to the migration all my lists are updated just fine inapp but every item is just loading in the widget tried removing the widget and adding it again tried stopping all services tried reinstalling nothing works
2,the invite user feature is horrible you can only do it through email as the text option doesnt work i used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app i was a user of wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as i can tell
2,wunderlist was an excellent app used to get my reminders on email now i dont get any reminders at all hence dont see the use of this app i have checked my phone settings and the app settings and the reminders are on but still no reminders either via app or email
2,still cannot see tasks due today automatically on the widget or on the live tile the overdue tasks are in red now but still nothing on the ones due today who wants to take 10minutes every morning to put all tasks due today and mark them in my day  this could be done automatically with an optin button in the options but still nothing
2,cant use without a ms account improved sync widget doesnt allow you to chose which list youd like to see without going into the app
2,failed to arrange my tasks by dragging them as used to do with wunderlist
2,why the comments section is not available yet as i checked most of users needed it we had it in wunderlist but here it is not possible to put a comment with recorded date in any list task
2,it takes too long to update lists my wife and i share lists but it takes days sometimes as long as a week for changes to show up on each others lists the wonderlist app updated almost immediately we miss wonderlist
2,application is very good but the issue in synchronisation some times it wasnt sys and i have to sing out and sign in again its lose my modified list
2,i understand that sometimes you need to replace product but it beats me why they didnt keep wunderlist and just ditched idea of todo list maybe they dont want something that isnt tied to microsoft anyway app for now sucks my shared lists from before dont work it was my main usage as it was so simple
2,so so sad  i loved wunderlist i used it to share lists with co workers daily tasks and grocery lists now that its linked to microsoft i can no longer use without creating an email account with them im so bummed it would be great if there was an option to use the app without creating an email account
2,had to retract my initial positive review as after longer use i started to spot issues mainly notifications dont work at all even after whitelisting the app in battery management
2,nice integration with teams  planner would get an extra star if i could assign tasks directly from to do
2,sorry but the migration from wunderlist made some things worse the architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately why do i need to flag each task to make it appear on my day  if i assign a task for today i want it to appear already in my day otherwise whats the point of this my day not too many customization possibilities the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant some reminders are not working i hope this can help
2,i have finally given up with this application although it works ok on its own not being part of outlook calendar  mail on my andoid phone is a drag if i put a to do into my calendar i like to also add it to my to do list but having to run this as a second stand alone app is far from ideal on my windows phone it was integrated into outlook as it is on the pc why isnt it part of outlook
2,assigning task is a problem and not available the reminder is also wanting
2,not much better than wunderlist but now its attached to my microsoft account for work so i cannot share my personal lists like the grocery list with my family
2,so installed this on mac after been a wanderlust user told me to create microsoft account so i did after a day it said session expired logged back in everything had gone so thought id give this a try but cannot log in
2,пожелание разработчикам невозможно перемещать списки подзадач вверх и вниз в версии для windows удерживаю левой кнопкой мыши тяну и ничего не происходит сделайте специальные точки за которые можно тянуть по вертикали посмотрите как в google keep это реализовано и сделайте также в мобильной версии у вас тоже удобно а на пк просто бесит неужели никто не жаловался на это
2,another shity microlimp product they cant even copy a decent app
2,hi to microsoft team request  1 to be able to print a list with only the items marked with an asterisk which are classified in alphabetical order request  2 for all tasks from all lists marked with an asterisk and which are all grouped in the same place these tasks should be displayed in alphabetical order under their respective list and not grouped in a single list  and also have different options to print a single or all lists with sorting options thank you
2,looks good imported fine from wunderlist but will not sync with my desktop pc on windows 10 huge disappointment and has affected productivity its in its early stages as an app so ill cut them a little slack unfortunately my clients will not here is hoping it gets sorted
2,no assistant from support in around one month still no notifications unless app is open cannot be used for reminders phone has been reset in this time and app reinstalled  issue persists please confirm if this is by design
2,mtd does not have the email reminder feature most of the time my reminders dont show in the notification bar they always did on wunderlist etc bring wunderlist back its much simpler more intuitive and has better features
2,love the app as i am one of the migrated users from wanderlist but have been a bit disappointed with the following after using to do 1 option to change from task list to pure check list 2 cant install the app on my pc although it is already on my android phone
2,widgets not working in latest update
2,unfortunately the app somehow does not actually give you reminders on the time and date you set them very disappointing i had hoped this would be fixed moving from wunderlist to this replacement the problem seems to be that whenever you do not complete a task on the due date and leave it as is the app will no longer remind you of anything if all your tasks are in the future it will remind you on that date although it might decide to do so later than planned weird ass bug needs a fix
2,bring back wunderlist my list wont sync with people and im having issues
2,as you mentioned i checked my settings sound has been enabled yet my reminders dont have sound
2,hate the move of completrd to bottom i have shopping list in the order the items are as i go round the supermarket tick as i put in cart untick as i need again used to still be in order when showing completed to untick now they are below and in scrambled order there should have made change an option i will have to look for a new to do app very sad bring back ability to have completed items show in original positions in list amongst uncomplicated items
2,widget does not allow you to input to specific lists makes for a hassle to open the whole app to add milk to my grocery list
2,the notification feature doesnt work for my phone its mi note8
2,this app changed recently in an annoying way now completed tasks are no longer sorted or even sortable we use this app for shopping lists and have previously appreciated the ability to sort a list we use repeatedly in alphabetical order now its impossible to sort the completed taske for reuse thats just lame
2,i dont know if anyone else is experiencing this but the app glitches constantly with chrome os whenever i flip to my day the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible i used it on my android phone and previously on my macbook with no problem i loved the my day function and am loathe to switch to a different app but i dont think i have a choice
2,new update makes planned inconvenient i do like that you can group them now a much desired thing from wunderlist but i cant see overdue anymore can you please add overdue when viewing this week its inconvenient to flip between categories to see everything on one page
2,where is calender
2,a lot worse ux than wunderlist
2,a fantastic and helpful app became useless with the last update grouping open and completed tasks may be helpful for some but for some types of lists it would be really handy to have all tasks together for example a picking list or shopping list with the items sorted in order of their position in the warehouse you do not need everything every time so you can just uncheck the items when needed during a round possibly hiding the completed tasks to minimize screen cluttering this was possible before but with the recent updates all completed tasks have moved to a separate list all custom sorting is lost dear microsoft please re enable these features you could provide an option in settings to use one or the other maybe even on a list level 2 stars because it used to be a good app otherwise i would have now given it only 1 star
2,all of my notifications from a day disappear if i clear one after midnight whats the point of a to do list that wont allow notifications to persist
2,a new feature of microsoft to do compared to wunderlist is notifications being cleared at the start of every new day this is incredibly annoying because if i dont have time to get to it i want it to be a constant annoying reminder so i know to get around to it i would rather continue to use wunderlist if the recurring tasks was implemented offline instead of requiring the server to give you a recursive task
2,please add a duedate on substep on a task
2,need ability to sort completed tasks
2,at first i liked that i could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order i use this app also as a grocery list so every time i want to add the done tasks i have to go throw everything why cant you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves the way it is now chaotic it is very user unfriendly and time consuming
2,migrating from wunderlist but to be honest with zero integration with google calendar as wunderlist hadthis does not work for me off to todoist which has full integration really dont understand why you would close wunderlist before having the same features in todo
2,i have down graded my review because show completed  hide completed features have been removed also the ability to edit an item has also disappeared
2,everything is three colors black white and bg color nothing feels separate or distinct meaning i find it hard to visually separate individual tasks to do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump the star shouldnt be the same color as the background if its supposed to stand out please make the star stand out more with a banner like wunderlist and with a different color
2,really miss wunderlist this just feels like a list of work i have to do rather than a list of possibilities from which to choose to do is a clunky pc type office app wunderlist was a fun life mobile app ill be looking for an alternative to to do
2,it was great until the latest release broke most of the useful functionality
2,i switched over to microsoft to do after being notified that wunderlist would not be available with the most recent update to the app the planned list now only shows a filtered view and i have to group it by date to even see it for each day previously i could see everything at once by due date even overdue items i can appreciate that everyone might not want to see everything there should be an all option if you are going to limit this looks like i get to find a new app
2,also forced to move from wunderlist im missing the part on my widget where i could see todays tasks but also those for my week and the overdue tasks as well please improve
2,not as good or sleek as wunderlist i miss wunderlist
2,please provide a way to sort completed tasks when you want to uncheck them to add them back to the list you have to hunt for the item ugh
2,manwe cannot have an alarm type alert hereit brings a problem
2,wunderlist migration dont like microsoft to do i really miss wunderlist i miss when i would save a link to wunderlist and it would let me select the list i needed not so in todo im trying to figure out how to leave todo for trello or todist this is a bummer might just leave my stuff in todo and start all over again
2,actually wasnt a terrible replacement for wunderlist until the last update the one feature i used all the time was the ability to show completed items with uncompleted and sort the whole list and then hide completed items again leaving everything sorted now you can no longer merge the lists and sort why take something out that was actually useful now this app is virtually useless for me
3,برنامه خوبیه چون خیالت راحته تو گوشی ذخیره نمیشن دسته بندیش خوبه ولی نقص داره هنوز قابلیت بکاپ تو حافظه گوشی نداره اگه حواست نباشه چیزی پاک کردی قابلیت برگشت نداره و مقداری نسبت به نسخه کلاسیک مقداری دیر لود میشه
3,reminders sometimes dont work especially if set through browser on desktop or if we edit description after setting the reminder
3,i really like this app but i dont like microsoft i have gotton locked from this app so many times
3,its not as nice as wunderlist was
3,the widget constantly blanks out and i have to reopen the app to get my lists to show again this is the only reminders app ive found to do this besides that i really enjoy using this but having nothing show on my homescreen widget is killing it for me
3,the app is good and useful with great features it has everything that you need for a basic to do list app but the reason for my 3 stars is that the widget is broken
3,its extremely limited there is no natural language processing even in english you cant just type buy bread on monday or call max at 9 which has been a basic features of this class of apps for years there is only one level of subtasks i wanted to switch to it from todoist because im not a power user and would be happy with a basic app but it lacks even the basics
3,for some reason the widget tends to switch list at random id like to see the option to set a default list in the widget as well as location based reminders
3,i love this app so far it is simple to add notes but reminder is missing every day because there is no option to add alarm  can you add this feature in next update 
3,good app  but needs lot of improvement
3,i really cant change notification sound and it uses the same phone notification
3,i think that if it was linked to a calender it would be perfect
3,i really like that i can set individual reminders for each task in the my day screen whats annoying is when i set a quick task via the notification panel i choose the date the task is for say for 3 days time but then when i choose reminder it defaults to today instead of the date the task is set for edit repeat weekday reminders are out of sync possibly by a day im getting them on a saturdayand nothing on a monday
3,good simple add to track your task i havent explored the full features
3,this update has broken it its not giving me all my notifications of todos and those it does it doesnt mark them as done unless i open the app
3,microsoft has many applications available applications available are not advertised properly to all users would be amazing if microsoft would have sales reps contact customers to see how customers are using their applications customer software challenges and provide solutions for their customer using their applications maybe microsoft will find 80 to 90 of customer issues could be resolved with the standard applications and provide customers upgrade solutions for their issues
3,it should be possible to move subtasks between tasks and lists having to cut and paste is very inconvenient this works on ipados why not android
3,back button doesnt shut down application
3,widget doesnt load upon phone restart on samsung s20 fe it fixes itself once i load the app outside of that this is a great app
3,i hoped it have a timetable something
3,very good app for maintaining my tasks and important work need some improvements 1 the reminder doesnt work properly and informs if the deadline is passed only after the app is opened 2 there are issues with the updation of tasks from the pc application to the mobile application please fix these otherwise the app deserves a 5 star rating
3,i want to use it but it requires a microsoft account it looks good though
3,great app for managing your activities helped me alot but there is some issues like the notifications doesnt always shows and reminds me that i have to do the task
3,note icons issue is fixed shared lists are not syncing properly when completing an item from the owner list it doesnt get completed on a shared users list but if a shared user checks an item is complete it is checked as complete on the owners list the sync is broken
3,new user
3,please add an oled friendly dark colour scheme to the widgets
3,overall it is good but i have several suggestions that will make it much better please contact me i would pay to have a better app than a mediocre free one and just so im clear your updates seem to focus on sharing and connections that is lipstick on a pig build the best app then worry about the connections
3,it stops working in between times sometimes it stops reminding me about my tasks and sometimes it does please fix this
3,please unify gui and workflow of planner and to do
3,it serves the purpose but its not exactly what i want in the way of organization
3,please allow me to set due time also instead of just due date
3,it was working all good until the recent update i use it on a split screen on a tablet previously the left hand side list bar was automatically hidden if the screen is small now it always stays which means the task list on the right is impossible to read
3,i like it but it started putting a note icon below each item i add to the list it makes the item box twice as tall and its super annoying
3,it a decent basic app for what i need my only current issue is that the height of each task box way too much white space on each individual task
3,can it show the schedule into calendar view
3,so sad that wunderlist must gone will this one expect the expectation why i cant open to do in web browser
3,homescreen widget dropdown for day task etc isnt working 
3,im a student who is tryna get my life more organized and im a big microsoft fan so i was happy when i saw this app im not sure if anyone else is having this problem but my app isnt posting my notifications unless im in the app for eg i set a reminder and that reminder on u goes off if im in the app and doesnt go off when im out of the app no notifications appear when im outside the app im voting it a 3 because im not sure
3,there should be a note keeping feature
3,sync not happen properly in time  takimg longer time  pc and mobile  and attachtment of picture not showing thumblail preview 
3,please make widget more cool
3,make the list searchable within the list if you have a lot of tasks within a list get ready to do a lot of scrolling to find that task
3,i need a good alarm with this app not just a beep
3,shame that when someone is creating a task there is no notification to the person this task is assigned to
3,this app is able to sync across your devices and has a simple user interface still id like greater organization facilities than are currently available i wish you could assign tags on items in different lists and then filter by tag for example i have a work list with my tasks in it and id like to assign tags corresponding to the work sub project the task belongs to
3,please fix the android bug whereby every new item added gets a note added too  very annoying
3,bug some items without notes show in the list with the note icon underneath on ios the same list correctly doesnt show any note icon
3,microsoft has screwed up a really good app
3,for a little over a week ive been experiencing a bug where every time i create a new todoitem in a list the little icon pops up indicating theres a note in the item even though there never is ive even tried adding and removing a note to see if it goes away and it doesnt make any difference not a huge deal but it takes up space on my screen and makes it harder to find list items that do actually have notes so its been fairly annoying
3,tasks on outlook on my desktop are categorised which basically splits my to do list in to sections projects next tasks waiting for etc these categories do not pull through to this app so my list is just a mish mash of everything muddled together without the categorisation this is a really key feature for me and i find it strange that categorisation of tasks doesnt exist on this dedicated app for managing tasks please promote this to the top of your backlog
3,im using the latest android version of todo sometime in the last month or so any entry containing a url ends up duplicating that url many times deleting the duplicates within the entry works at first but then the duplicates come back also please add a working setting to optionally require confirmations of task deletes or provide a trash can from which you can recover deleted items
3,why to do auto add the notes in all tasks
3,microsoft can do better
3,i have two problems 1if i am offline and application is closed then on my android 70 app do not works 2i am unable to disable vibrationi do not founded in options menu please help
3,decent it would be good to add custom notifications
3,previous versions had more fine grained options in the settings they made the app really useful id like them back
3,app is good sticky notes would have make it more usefull
3,its good once you figure it out
3,latest gripe repeating tasks have started appearing on the prior calendar day rather than the proper repeating due day but not always very weird
3,pretty useful if you sign in to your account you can see the same information on your windows computer
3,the widgets that comes has bugs when ever i open any app and closes it the widgets view goes to myday task view regardless of what you have set it to then in order to fix it i have to open the app
3,need more user friendly interface
3,ms cant add requested plan tomorrow feature for 3 years its not rocket science
3,sync is a bit slow widget does not update very quickly either otherwise smooth interface and no other issues
3,i set reminder for a particular time but it reminds me at some different time than the one i set and my phone always connected to internet i wish this issue could be sorted out
3,mejorando
3,i tried downloading this app to see how it was cause i have been trying some microsoft apps and discovered they arent bad but one problem i have with it is that the first button i see should be for task not list cause it is confusing i hope youll fix it
3,just started using this app its nice you can connect others to view you to do list
3,whats the point if the reminder alarm goes off only when i open the app it doesnt send notifications
3,great app but latest version had a bug that nobody seems to have reported  all newly added items have the note icon whether there is a note added or not
3,i wish that once i completed a task it resorts to the bottom of the day so that the next task shows up on top of the planned list
3,good but cant share my lists
3,notification does not work it would be great if it did
3,i would prefer the ability to sync my tasks with google calendar
3,all in al its a good app but for the last couple of months the reminders arent working no push notifications are received i checked all my permissions for this app and power settings but cant see anything that would prevent it from pushing notifications any ideas
3,bell sound is missing when i click completed in widget mode
3,egg
3,layout is horrible give me a simple list view and the ability to hide the tacky theme
3,widget doesnt support other list besides my day 5 star if functionality is added
3,i cant select multiple images to add to a list its as if the option is there but not implemented  says i have 1 image selected but im not able to select another one simultaneously
3,planned your day reminder  in this feature if we can get to see the summary or list of our todays task also that would be great i will update to 5star once this feature is available
3,i get a bit frustrated that its not very versatile in how lists can be organised and i find i inadvertently delete items too easily but i havent tried many of the alternative apps to see if they are any better i have used it for about 6 years previously as wunderlist and its my most used app
3,please include board view for tasks and list side by side showing all tasks under them would helpful on tablet and pc im using this app to plan for next year competitive exam it is difficult to add tasks for complete year one by one please add calendar view so that by selecting any date we can add tasks to start that day like google calendar but make it easy to use and with goodcustomisable ui also need transparent widget
3,если б еще логин майкрософта не нужен был было бы идеально
3,you need to add tomorrow tab because i plan my day before i sleep so everything is ready after i wake up
3,im close to leaving todoist now loving todo more and more cant jump because theres still no alexa integration
3,i still wish it had a more unique name than todo like at least wunderlist 20
3,the application accepts date and time in the past for reminder it should verify date and time
3,google calendar is better than it
3,would be great if it linked to calendar
3,except for reordering items the app is ok i should be able to reorder items by drag and drop at the main screen i should not need to go to a separate screen just for reordering let alone having to click up and down arrows one step at a time so tedious
3,i used to do on my htc it was ok but i do not receive notifications on my redmi note 8 pro now it is really bad thing
3,if give us progress it be excellent
3,i like the app but wish i could have smaller text on the android version where the actual list is that is text which is a little smaller in size as on some of the main screens
3,i have just installed this application and want to know the feature of assigned to me please help
3,developers can you please reduce the spacing between items on lists also please include a simple colour assignment to list items  this would enable fast identification and sorting when grocery shopping e g all fruit  vegetables can have a green background while dairy can be white medication red previous review  forced update from wonderlist purchased by ms some time ago works as before but now fewer tasks seen in the list due to increased spacing would like to go back please
3,still wishing for you to bring back the starred items by category really dont know why you had to remove this feature when you took over wunderlist it was extrenely helpful espevially for organizing shopping trips please bring it back i miss having what used to be starred items organized by the file they are listed under now its one massive iist under important while the category is there it was so much nicer under wunderlist please i hope you bring that feature back thank you
3,meh
3,mediocre replacement this app is supposed to be taking the place of other list and to do makers but it does not this app builds checkoff lists nothing more no matter how they try to dress it up in the immortal words of sarah palin putting lipstick on a pig this only makes checkoff lists you cant make a list with numbers or dots or dashes you cant alphabetize it other than having still be a checkoff list looking for another app this one truly microsoft sucks
3,a lof improvements made since launch one thing im still missing is the tasks are not sorted in the week view in the same way wunderlist did i expected to see tasks organized by due date  list name  task title but i get tasks due on the same date ordered randomly the web app version also doesnt have a dark theme
3,dont have skip option is you dont want to create account btw app is good
3,seen nice so far
3,widget is very buggy also add an option to sync with google calendar or outlook calendar
3,its great but should have some option to put my own photos on background
3,i tried signing in by my email id it said to create one when i tried to create it said that my id is already registered i know my id is registered and i jave a microsoft account but it doesnt accept while signing in then how do i sign in
3,good for daily too list but not much more
3,very helpful but will be more if you can add time management matrix from eisenhower please think of this feature
3,everything is fine except the notification doesnt ring untill i open the app by myself and that is so irritating what will be the moto of reminders if they cant remind you properly
3,really frustrating that i cant have a unified my day view for both my work and personal account its such a hassle switching accounts
3,its an ok replacement to wunderlist but its worse i cannot duplicate a list from the app which is a basic feature one would expect from a todo list tracker
3,real shortfall is the inability to allocate tasks and share lists outside of the organisation fix this and id give 5 stars
3,love this app please add a option to remind me every day at a specific time that i choose remind me every day option sometimes i repeat some task daily so i dont need to create them again and again there is option repeat the task daily but it there is no option to remind daily
3,i loved wunderlist and after its unfortunate demise i switched to todoist have to admit that it is a superior app but its pricing is too much for a todo app this one on the other hand is free yet offers much of the same functionality except for any intuitive reminders whats up with todo apps and reminders these days dear developers please im begging you add the basic time recognition upd please fix the widget shutting down and not displaying tasks for no good reason
3,good app at what it does i think theres some functionality readily available in other apps that would greatly improve this one im no programmer so maybe theres a reason they cant include it
3,great app please add a streak counter for repetitive tasks
3,i have to add tasks daily again and again i dont know why i have to add them again even if i have selected them to repeat daily all else is good appreciate the efforts
3,nice app but still needs more improvement
3,please please please add the option for duplicating tasks im using it for an operational purpose where i have to re do task listing from scratch everything else seems fine i used to use wunderlist and the duplicate feature is the best feature in it please add it soon
3,simple clean and effective i like it but its really frustrating that it doesnt integrate with google assistant like other popular todo list apps do
3,app is beautiful and plus point is that it has a desktop client too needs some work with auto generation features i dont want to add everything to my day manually from planned or other lists whatever is set to repeat and is added to my day must get added automatically want to set it up once and forget repeating tasks the widget keeps crashing and goes unresponsive after some time i need to manually open the app only then widget updates please look into these and keep up the good work
3,from an old wunderkist fan design and migration is nice thank you please bring back weekly to do widget or at least make possible to select only earlier tasks to show up in widget additionally in widget if due date is passed please show the task in red color i dont want to see may tax payments next year in the widget please bring weekly list to the widget thank you
3,not getting notifications on my samsung device assignments that are shared do not alert me once the task is completed by the other party
3,require notification and messaging features in the app
3,please tell how to get a audible alarm after setting date and time in reminder without an audible alarm at set date and time for any task this app is of no use to me
3,fairly limited
3,very easy to use only problem is notifications dont work on my phone i dont get a notification on my phone when a task is supposed to be due
3,last app wunderlist is better than this beacuse if we make list under folder with defferent folders and see list under widgets we can see only list without folder it makes me disturbe in wunderlist we can see list under folder in widgets so that i like that app please solve it
3,less pastit notes thanks
3,would love it if the tasks had an option of being hidden once completed otherwise i would rate 5stars
3,great app but please add the times set for reminder to the list view so you can see when what needs to be done by just glancing over your list instead of having to click on each one edit still no fix to this also due date sorting is not sorting to specific time
3,great but sometimes the reminders dont work like when set to recur daily or monthly they only sometimes remind you at the specified times
3,falta muita coisa
3,the ux is classic wonderlist but the feature set is still not up to where wunderlist left off how can you acquire a product and the release only a subset of functionality two years later
3,good app but could be better
3,please make the possibility to set my own wallpaper in the app because your pictures low resolution and they a little bit bad
3,doesnt sync with my phone app
3,just started using it so far so good may change rating after using it for awhile
3,sorting according to due time is not available for eg i have 3 task one at 5 am next at 7 and 9 am on repeated mode every day than it doesnt sort out according to time
3,the app is fine especially combined with the to do app on windows but whats really missing for me is having more flexibility in choosing the snooze period one hour max is not useful hours 05 day 1 day are all options that i definitely could use
3,it is good but it should remind us to do the tasks
4,enjoying so far i am sure there are more capabilities i am yet to discover makes life so much easier
4,simple app for simple tasks
4,love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better have scheduled todo items show up on the outlook calendar app this would be awesome have an option to hide certain lists from my day i have some lists i use as filler projects when theres free time and i dont want them taking priority over other necessary items i havent scheduled yet thank you for a great app thus far
4,app is really good but if you forget microsoft pwd is a huge pain to reset it
4,its great for keeping track of a busy life need collaboration opportunities within the program to allow for communicating with others on what they did_u
4,very good app for everyone
4,app is very useful however it works slow on my macbook
4,occasional issues with synchronizing lists but otherwise great
4,great but need to add some feature such as privacy with fingerprint or face lock
4,widget to app sync is very laggy and doesnt happen most of the times nokia 71 android 10
4,its now almost as good as wunderlist and has a dark theme and a nice dark widget please add commenting like wunderlist had as its really helpful on shared items migration could be better though as you have to share all the lists one by one again and delete the old ones where you are not the owner also it now forces you to use a microsoft account
4,в целом нравится но есть проблема очень ленивая синхронизация в компьютером делаю изменения на телефоне захожу в microsoft todo с windows 10 а там этих изменений нет и только спустя полминуты гдето появлюятся
4,please add feature that let me switch between lists by swiping right and left in list page thank you so much for this great app 
4,its really good got no complains really but the interface could possibly look a little cleanerbettermore minimal but its still clean fr fr
4,great app could you please add a reminder feature if you miss something at the minute if you have a task set to repeat weekly or daily etc if you dont complete the task then it disappears and no longer appears on the todo list even when set for a repeat reminder
4,great app one feature that could be added is the facility to copy tasks instead of moving them lists can be shared not just for working together but then just for those people to view the tasks in the list as and when they are updated
4,convenient and great
4,the scheduled reminders doesnt work the app notifies you only the first time
4,great app for keeping track of all my tasks i would like the option to repeat reminders only instead of repeating the whole task itself thanks
4,great but we need be able to set my day list a night before
4,this apps makes it easier to organise your day and goals with daily reminders and it is a fun app because you get to customize the themes of each goal
4,please make the mobile and desktop version like the web version its cleaner and more simple
4,needs comment option on each task
4,just started using good so far maybe a start date on tasks would help
4,add copy task with sub tasks to clipboard also reorder subtasks sometimes broken urgent 
4,todo is stylish and functional in all the ways is needs to be and beyond connecting seamlessly throughout the app on pc mobile and online i would love an integration for gmail or other such apps and perhaps a wear os app but this is a great app for todo lists and reminders
4,just using know exploring more
4,great app for all my to do lists there are just minor issues in syncing sometimes
4,crashes periodically however i absolutely love the app does exactly what i wanted and is super simple to use not all the extra complicated and unneeded mumbo jumbo as some of the similar apps i have tried
4,i love the app so far i really like how user friendly it is but this app has a very limited selection of themes please offer more themes to choose from also offering the ability to choose our own images from our computer or the internet for our task background would be great even though i chose not to use the trello task app they have the above features i mentioned and i loved having those options
4,its good but wish google assistant would add to it
4,great app but if scheduled time more than 2 weeks it make it better
4,its alright
4,helpful app though some times doesnt update when someone else adds items bot not a frequent issue
4,simple to use and works great so far just wish that scheduled tasks could be shared with the calendar as an option
4,allow reminders to pop up all in all its ok
4,i have a suggestion in the all lists tab please give the option of sorting the tasks within the different categories theyve been created i need both the categorisation of tasks into different groups and the ability to arrange them within those categories say by due date or alphabetically
4,still to work out the kinks
4,nice app but complicated setting are there at some points but this is best app  i ever used in to do works
4,nice for productivity
4,very simple easy to use would like to see it developed just a little more to include more choices of background images or ability to add custom background images
4,nada mal
4,easy to use but needs some features we mostly use it for a communal shopping list it would be nice if you could assign categories to items such as frozen produce it works great for a to do list either shared or personal
4,thanks just started  looks great cheers
4,great app would be nice if it synced with calenders better
4,this is not reminding me even though i set an remainder option
4,i use a daily for tasks and lists there could be one more subcategorysublist it would be nice to show pictures in line too
4,well structured
4,its a nice but i personally need a full screen pop up its convenient for me personally
4,item duplicate automatically
4,wish we could attach images and use tags for workpersonalchores school etc excellent app regardless love it
4,slow to open needs an option to list in order of oldest task first great overall
4,great app loving the interaction with o365
4,a search function in completed items would increase the stars to 5
4,on online anywhere can review the task category wise task status is the key to review the pending task
4,the interface is not very intuitive but does more than a satisfactory job once you get used to it id like to see a more colourful home page and more theme options and the option to connect to google calendar clock microsoft your phone etc overall solid app for daily use
4,great for getting tasks from phone to pc not so good at understanding long lists on phone
4,simple to use nice clean look keep personal and business tasks separate
4,one flaw the app doubles every url put into a note field this becomes an issue when you reedit the note and the duplicates then get reduplicated
4,great app helps me a lot but kinda annoys me that when i set a reminder to repeat every day it doesnt remind me every day and i have to set it manually anyways still one of the best apps for managing you time and increasing productivity try it for a week  you wont regret it
4,it would be great if we could have geographic reminders like when you drive home and it will remind you
4,convenient
4,microsoft is great at listening to reviews i still miss wunderlist but to do is close
4,6 xz
4,excellent design for to do lists and easy to use but i havent been able to figure it how to fully sync and integrate with my laptop ms office 365 version so 4stars instead of 5 but otherwise stellar
4,keeps me organized
4,excellent app for sharing tasks across family members would give it more stars if it worked as the task app for outlook
4,very useful awaiting further updates as have been announced by microsoft with synchronization with teams
4,very good for managing tasks and very efficient in collaborating with others
4,great organizational tool i use it every day
4,used to take the place of wunderlist actually liking it much better it would be helpful to see who created the task who edited it and when also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a commentquestion would be super helpful other than that very satisfied
4,works well with office products
4,like it a lot very useful with shared lists would also be nice to have the option to be able to schedule tasks on a calendar for crossreference
4,great app thank you microsoft
4,fine app would be better if we could sync it with other apps as well
4,i love the minimalist style of the app nothing crops up to clog space until you need it and once you need something then its intuitively handy thanks guys
4,there is something wrong with the world look at all these reviews people give it 1 star rating  thats ok but they complain about the app like they own it developers give you the app to use for free instead of being rude or mad you could just give a polite feedback so that they can improve or just use some other app remember you dont own it
4,not the old palm app but still usefu l
4,simple and neat wish it could let me add priority on tasks and allow me to reorder the tasks within planned tab
4,needs more work notes are awkward maybe what i want is something simpler
4,i think the app with a time table for sorting tasks will become more useful 
4,awesome and esay to use
4,good app that syncs with outlook widget needs transparent options
4,my day is a great feature but perhaps it will help to be able to plan it atleast the previous evening
4,they should give some type of sound feedback when u finish a task
4,4 stars because location based reminders is missing best task management app in 2020
4,please add time stamps and ranking to sub tasks in each task
4,this app is so good but can be better on remainder
4,i like this app
4,excellent app but please add recyclebin in the app
4,very nice app using it regularly to get reminders
4,works very well across all my devices information and attachments
4,it is a real time management tool
4,very easy to use and share with your family you can create groups and asign tasks i dont add the last start because it is easy to click done and i use it at the market then something can be changed to done and you forget to buy
4,the worst thing is its not integrated with one drive to attach or edit file
4,i would like a more in depth prioritization system beyond a star thinking the quadrants from the 7habits of highly effective people
4,shopping grocery listsapointmentson all devices to update and edit when you think of it
4,really useful it helps me organize and keep track of my daily tasks i use to do on both windows and android my only problem is when it sync the changes on desktop  the widget on my phone doesnt change at all until i open the app a refresh button on the widget would do or make it sync like google keep
4,great to do list waiting for new features eg notes should have a comment section with timestamp
4,useful with good ui
4,very good app and easy to use
4,me gusta apenas la estoy implementando en mi día a día
4,great app but need to add mark complete check
4,it is simple to use just started to use
4,very good app for day to day planning
4,its nice and simple good for productivity
4,pretty good not quite as clear and quick as wunderlist but 90 as good
4,please add option to sort by reminder time
4,pretty good app would get 5 stars if 1 it had delete all checked items and 2 the reminder used the android alert system
4,helps to become more productive not using ai or recommendation engines
4,this app is actually more functional than wunderlist the app it devoured and that is really atypical for microsofts developers
4,i would like to set a background from pictures from my gallery not from the ones you gave me
4,need custom notification tone
4,ite very good app  but i felt microsoft apps consume more battery and little bit slow to open the pages  and there is no offline access pls update this to all apps thank you
4,overall has been good with helping me ger on top of things and organising myself but the reason i have had to leave a review today is because i have noticed when i paste a link into the description of a task it copies and pastes the link in twice please sort out the glitch hence why i am giving 4 stars instead of 5
4,please add a feature to assign tasks to multiple users and for no reason the app ads an empty note to every new task being created with the android app
4,syncs nicely between 2 users
4,easy to use exactly what i needed
4,fab list app be even better if you could sort steps of a task so incomplete steps are listed first thanks
4,awesome app 1 if you could add undo feature  if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo
4,enjoying it thus far
4,all in all working nicely i wish that it would be possible to add people to lists without the need to send them the link as it was possible in wunderlist
4,doesnt show you task in outlook calendar planned task arent shown in my day when they are actual
4,good app to remember work to do it could be more better if important point flashes time to time
4,very good application trustable from microsoft
4,simple and easy to use syncs on phone and pc which is very useful
4,would like to see an option for delete all completed tasks instead of having to select one at a time
4,really good app and i like my day function but still has lots things need to improve eg batch insert function it already could sync with outlook task but without subtask that a shame i believe that this app could be very powerful if it could work with outlook and onenote also its time to concern supported wear os
4,not flawless but works motivating
4,از حیث ابعاد مختلفی کامله مثل امکان گروه بندی امکان آپلود فایل امکان ساخت ساب تسک تنظیم سر رسید تنظیم یادآور امکان شیر وعهدهگذاری کارها به علاوه محیط بسیار کاربر پسند تنها مشکل اینه برای سابتسکها نمیتوان تاریخ سر رسید و عهدهگذاری داشت و میزان و نحوه روند انجام کار امکان نمایش ندارد  برای دوستان لازم میدونم بگم بین محیط ویندوز و اندروید به خوبی همگام سازی میشه و همچنین هر تقویمی که دستگاه روش نصب باشه رو نمایش میدهیعنی برای ویندوز ۱۰ تقیم کامل جلالی
4,very good use app
4,would be more effective if there was an option to add reminders for subtasks and option to add time deadline along with due date
4,love the app especially the sound it gives off when you tick off a task only thing is that you cant thoroughly organise the tasks you have set other than that i highly recommend
4,feature request 1 add transparent background option in widgets like after completing each task the size of the widget becoming small though actual size of the widget is large 2 provide option to view tasks pending for the week in widget
4,nice app but please add some alarm features in it  something we might not hear the notification call
4,i like the app easy to use and organize i just wished there was a way to turn the spell check off in it its miserable trying to type noneuropean style names in it
4,amazing app i am very happy to follow my tasks jobs etcamazing appbut i want the developers to keep an option which will continue everyday the same tasks it would be nice i have to always write my tasks daily
4,it fails to sync between devices which is highly desirable however its integration with mcalendar and mmail app is very useful
4,great does the basics i need it to tricky to move tasks to folders
4,it would be awesome if shared task reminders would sync right now only due dates sync
4,i think what this app needs most is some project management and task tracking abilities to see how much of task has been done task shouldnt remain in the dichotomy of to do and done
4,its very useful for the all
4,love it helps me to stay organized so mych more love the detailed features as well
4,if have difference label or icon can be used then is better
4,very useful simple  easy to use
4,this app is simple and easy to use after a year of trying other to do apps i have loaded this onto my phone and laptop the app works great and synchs great as well new graphics are awesome one detail that needs to be addresses deletion of completed tasks is very cumbersome
4,functionally good would be nice to have more personalisation options eg custom backgrounds etc
4,very useful would like tasks dated today to appear automatically in my day
4,excellent some unique features that make this my go to android task app although some other features either dont exist or are hard to find in future updates the following additions would be handy  create and sync tasks using onenote app currently desktop only  assign calendar event currently desktop only  have an option to plan tomorrows my day or even roll over incomplete tasks from today to tomorrow
4,very useful app 
4,app keeps asking for access to other apps we high i do not want to permit
4,the app is near perfect it has just one flaw for me adding pictures or files or other attachments why do i need to be online to add files to a reminder please make attaching files available offline to add an extra layer of convenience
4,really helpful simple and feature rich
4,its nice
4,its easy to use and perfect for all my lists
4,top notch easy to use and manage tasks or projects the reminders dont send full notifications quite often so a little bug to work on there
4,you can now be signed in with both a work or school account and a personal account in this app meaning that we now have all of desktop outlooks functions in a first party app still not sure why this is not built into mobile outlook and you cant display both accounts on the same widget
4,fairly easy to use very useful for shopping lists and to do lists
4,its overall very nice but small things keep frustrating me one particular thing is why cant you add reminders for custom days why pick a specific day
4,sir good app but pls add some features to this app it will make more interesting
4,works as described but not very intuitive theres plenty of choices for storing and organizing tasks and im still trying to decide which options work best for me
4,there seems to be a bug with the latest version where all new items have the note icon showing please fix its annoying
4,so far from my user experienceswitch from any doalready good  keeps getting better every update thank microsoft team
4,fairly good looking app if you cancel notification it doesnt remind you that the team hasnt completed would like a more naggy for individual tasks
4,great app simultaneously connects to desktop
4,one of the better todo lists out right meow very simple and straightforward the only problem i have is id like to see is an option for a daily recurring task to be automatically added to my day without having to go into the task and physically doing it every day then i will rate it 5 stars
4,add memo with overlapping facilities of diff memos
4,simply the best productivity app out there it fully integrates with outlook planner etc its very customizable and easy to use it used to be able to integrate with cortanas reminders but unfortunately since cortanas fate is still nebulous this feature is not what it used to be so its lacking support for some digital personal assistant reminders thats the only reason its not 5 stars for me
4,it would be nice if you could color code tasks otherwise a very good app
4,es muy completo para lo que necesito
4,easy to use  one additional feature you can add is to provide an option in themes where we can set some inspiring quotes from our gallery
4,great application however application is a bit not responsive
4,perfekt vor produktliste schwer mit ordner umgehen
4,i love the design and everything about it definitely recommend it just one problem there isnt a calendar that can be displayed to see your tasks please add that thank you
5,this helps so much getting things done its so satisfying to make stuff off the list 5 stars cant live without
5,making my life better it is good to have a todo list 
5,the search feature is much faster than the last app i was using i feel empowered

5,i find it very helpful to keep track of my day and keeps me on task
5,excellent very helpful a good way to share tasks with somebody we use it to buy groceries for example when were in costco one person can find one thing and the other person can find another thing and you check it off and you know its been found that makes it very fantastic
5,система дорофеев отлично ложится в этот инструмент рекомендую
5,o aplicativo é muito bom porém algumas coisas precisam ser melhoradas primeiro deveria ter um opção que você gravasse uma mensagem de voz registrando a tarefa por via de áudio segundo deveria ter uma opção de tarefa não cumprida um x vermelho que indica que a tarefa não foi cumprida porque quando eu registro uma tarefa para ser feita diariamente e algum dia eu não a cumpra não tem a opção de registrála como não feita e enquanto eu não colocála como feita o app não põe no dia seguinte
5,so far really liking it
5,nic
5,better than google task
5,so far so goodall wonderfully arranged according to my way and my headingseasy to use i only realized now that it shows under a different name with my numberhow do i edit this

5,best app pls add function of multiple intraday alarms for any task
5,im enjoying the structure of this app
5,great appunless your spouse controls it 
5,works
5,agregar una opción para poner una nota general en una lista de tareas
5,just what i needed
5,i use it as the grocery list for when i shop everybody in my family used to wait until i was busy doing something else to tell me about what they needed from the store and they would assume that since they told me that i heard them or retained the information which made for a lot of disappointments so i shared the app with the family so everybody can add to the list as needed for themselves as far as my family is concerned its a life saver for them 
5,best reminder and organizer app
5,easy to use and does what it says
5,simple and useful 
5,good and easy to use
5,multi functional app for daily tasks routine
5,excellent and frequent updates please improve notifications for queries  comments

5,finally after looking for several months i found the perfect todo app that is not annoying thanks microsoft
5,ajterth
5,its amazing i really like it its so easy and you can use it anytime and its encourage you to do your work faster and its so good 
5,good task reminder app very intergration with 0365
5,excellent app for setting up ur daily routine
5,for me the best app for organizing your life but some things should be improved though 1 you cant set monday as the first day of the week 2 having some of your notes appear both in planned and tasks and some in planned but not in tasks is bewildering besides planned and tasks there are two more lists  my day and important why so many overlapping lists 3 you cant change fixed time for reminder alarm for example tomorrow is always at 9 am you cant change that to say 10 am 4 you cant set quick alarm for example you cant type some note and then tap remind me in half an hour or in 15 minutes in two hours etc theres no such option 5 you cant insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders 6 you cant protect your reminders and notes with a password anyone can read them
5,works well for me several lists
5,a good app
5,it helps me remember things
5,love that my husband and i can share our lists
5,beautiful layout and well developed
5,awesome and multi device sharing
5,easy to keep yourself organised and prioritise your todos
5,absolutely astonishing
5,love this app and office 365 in general
5,the new update brings a lot that was desired most importantly list sharing with much better approach than wunderlist but task assigning within the shared list and chat on a particular task is still missing and this is something that still holds me back from fully migrating from wunderlist
5,best of the best
5,very nice app must try
5,myself and my husband find this very useful for things we have to do home repair groceries holiday lists
5,the best thing to type and remember our list
5,application is much nice but windows application having much synchronization issues it would be big improvement if it gets sync across all devices specially windows application
5,free
5,better than other app
5,ive used microsoft todo list for a while now and really enjoyed the seamless experience of having everything sync across i love how simple it is to add new items and create new lists the colour design and layout is perfectly straightforward having no clutter any actions added sync immediately to other devices using microsoft todo list i just wish actions added to myday list would save to each specific day like on a calendar so i can revisit those events
5,easy to use and very helpful
5,this added significantly to my recent productivity hights

5,thank you devs for an amazing app all in one without the unnecessary waste the others provide for a fee strongly recommend anyone reading for download confirmation dont forget to cancel your subscription to the other waste of moneyspace
5,very good app i tried other apps before some were simple and some were sophisticated this one mixed the simplicity and competence
5,great for keeping updated with work tasks administration or groceries
5,error cant add a step after other with an enter you ought to go to bottom  lacks cant search your tasks or steps with an option search into lists or steps sections
5,amazing superb
5,extremely good for work
5,love the fact it updates all 3 of my devices
5,i absolutely love it love it love it this is a good microsoft todo list and you can take it anywhere on the phone now and markoff anything i love it hope it doesnt change its taste just as good as it is now
5,a 5 star because its the best todo app ive triedand ive tried a lot well thought out and well integrated with office although it works great as a standalone app i use it for multiple businesses projects personal etc
5,excellent app i use it for groceries lists work todo lists camping lists saving documents etc etc fantastic and easy to use
5,very good tool for day to day use
5,it will only alarm if you will open the app
5,the best to do app on the market very easy to use very intuitive and logical interface
5,feels very intuitive the steps feature is awesome i wish that the other tasks can be merged to another task to form as another step it would be great to group and order random ideas without needing to look for other related tasks but my love for this app is there xx

1,does not support more than only one outlook calendar moreover wont work with i365 calls inet connection failure while just added calendar
1,are there any plans to develop a corresponding watchface in the samsung app store for samsung watch devices update when 
1,कछ कम क app नह टइम बरबद
1,vary bad
1,dont use this app for real
1,calander doesnt sync properly even if you add event adds it to different days
1,my calendar events not showing in widget  maybe it doesnt support my phone this is why i am uninstalling it
1,sorry maybe i was a little too harsh anyway this app is kind of confusing for me using it is not comfortable for me
1,not easy to operate and not good interface uninstalled already was expecting much better
1,doesnt work properly 
1,0 intuitiveuselessapp
1,its not working properly now the sync was very slow overall very bad experience
1,confusing as hell
1,i have been trying to contact the developer but he is responding me please tell me how can i use the app on my other devices
1,why the tasks dont reapet every week this is useless
1,how to change celceus to farenheight
1,bekar
1,was good but no longer updating real time
1,not so good at all how to enter stuff and completely useless very bad  
1,i cant copy past the activities for other days i must write them on every day on the calendar
1,seems like a good idea but doesnt actually do anything but waste more time completely useless cant find calendar events each event has to be reentered manually why would anyone want an app that is just more work stupid huge waste of time
1,widget doesnt work
1,one feature add your app reminder with music tone
1,sounds like a wonderful idea for time management but it wont show half of the things on my calendar and kind of ruins the entire purpose
1,couldnt figure out why there was a gray line in addition to the red line showing the hour also all day events show as a small sector instead of the entire circle looking at a regular calendar is still easier
1,someone created a time productivity app that takes too much time out of your day to understand it
1,scam got my google calendar scammed please dont install
1,helps me somehow
1,why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar i dont want this private app to access my google calenders and phone calender instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app im deleting this the ui is great but i dont want you to link with my private apps
1,it cannot work by itself and its not userfriendly
1,does not pick up the calender events despite setting them
1,does not detect my devices calendar device default app but instead asks me to download a calendar
1,need to about to change the events colors thank you other setting has the color plate to select why is the events that controlling the whloe widget background but only having 16 colors and it doesnt shows the color that i chosen they are not the same color the magenta shows up light purple not matching with my phone setting and my widgets and i hope there has a setting that can one click and the whole app color hue would be the color i like or choose i dont like blue
1,previously good currently bad this app takes you straight to google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set its on calendar only it doesnt even show that any event has been set on the app itself i was using this app as sort of a time table but if im not able to see my plans for the day then whats the use pls fix it
1,bad
1,i bought tgis application once in my infinex and when i turn to my samsong i download it and he said buy it once and for ever  what is going on people
1,i dont know why this app is hard to understand  i have seen many positive comments and thats why i installed it but this is complicated or may be i want something else which this app doesnt offer
1,hard to control make this app easy to control its eating my head
1,i dont really liked it much  waste of intenet
1,i unistalled just for the costumer service i was ready and willing to give the app a shot but given the cruel uncaring and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works i will be uninstalling imediately
1,google calander doesnt synchronise
1,this is a waste app after few days it started to shiw nothing and it says it takes time to sync with the calender but still after 24 hrs they dont sync please dont install this app and then expect to be productive
1,is there a way to add events directly  i dont want to sync it with calendarit is very time consuming
1,doesnt sync with calendar
1,the settings dont work well and its really confusing when it doesnt function at all 
1,very complex
1,rly love the design but way too scattered for me
1,might be a good app but complicated to use
1,not the best did nor enjoy
1,include monthly to do list which helps students to create timetable
1,im sure this would be a great app if you could actually use it but it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you dont have one
1,cannot use without existing calendar
1,not what i thought it was this only blocks out time for your calendars i was looking for something that would help with daily routines  i even tried to use the calendar before giving up but it refused to sync so its useless
1,there should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander
1,really frustating configuration
1,too complicated it probably has a lot of but its not intuitive enough
1,in this app it is very hard to use
1,doesnt work on all android wear os devices specifically doesnt work with the watch active2
1,no es intuitiva
1,puts all info in default google calendar
1,how it should work is fantastic and perfect for me but whenever i have my schedule laid out and planned the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over only to have them deleted again i really really want to use it why does it make it so unable to
1,dependant on another calendar app why why do i need to have another app to use this app i cant add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to google calendar besides i dont use gc anymore since i once missed an event which i put a reminder through the gc app because it never reminded me i read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes i have an idea why it happened
1,uninstallednot at all what i thought it was this entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have everything syncs both ways so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendars with the same things wouldve been neat if it actually had some kind of function but i dont need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app
1,not sync with google calendar
1,this is demo only
1,i like this app its just that whenever i enter something in my calendar it would not sink right away
1,i wanted to like it iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view its no good for planning a few hours view and thats it scrolling hour by hour day by day useless its sole function appears to be to tell you what youve got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as i can see cloud cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesnt work so no go there either
1,uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date disappointing
1,cool visual but doesnt work the way i thought it would i dont like organizing my hourbyhour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events i wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app but every time i want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which i dont like good concept but i dont see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway
1,used to love it but the latest version broke it couldnt get it to work all widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break tried all settings didnt work fix it and ill reconsider my rating
1,clicking on the widget doesnt open the app anymore  
1,good on paper tried it out and off the bat wouldnt sync any news items wish it had an option to at least input items directly either way didnt work
1,lnot friendly interface
1,it gives the option to add a local calendar but doesnt let you use it unless you also give permission to use a google or outlook calendar kind of defeats the purpose of doing a localonly calendar if i cant actually use it
1,does not work properly  does not update wit hcalendar entries  worst thing  cannot aak my money back
1,it has a lot of functionality bugs some of my events were not adding after restaring the app other events just disappeared etc i m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working thanks
1,language of the app doesnt change at all places
1,its really hard to shedule
1,not felt user friendly
1,vvvvbad
1,instalei de novo e não mudou muito minha ideia quero um calendário e não uma ferramenta pra integração com o calendário do google tá de sacanagem
1,inaccurate  always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesnt
1,nothing work i have my calendar prepared for months and nothing come inside the sectograph even i added new one nothing appeared
1,want to customize colors buy the pro version not a chance thanks for nothing b
1,24 hour mode is a pro feature
1,bought the paid version the app fails to get data from anything except gmail good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity
1,i cant synchronized to my calendar
1,dude dont we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with xxxxxxx hi thanks for the attentive reply though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me i did find one that works nicely looking forward to more replies hopefully relevant or none at all
1,purchased the full version which did nothing opted for a 24 hour face again nothing tried to add additional events in upcoming days did not show up at all
1,after installing the app i check to see if my reacurring event would show up and it did that one time so minutes after i insalled i had to let it go
1,most of my google calendar events doesnt appear in the sectograph app if i try to delete some events which is appeared it cannot remove in the app also i prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier
1,приложение путает am и pm
1,only certain google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless a great idea that is flawed in execution
1,wew
1,alarm nahi he
1,its not working 
1,deleted app due to not putting things in i was looking forward to using this app i am getting the same issues as sharlyn
1,the idea is great however it adds only event to my calendar i like circle planer idea and that i simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle this has potential but make it simple and functional i was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going make it that 7 years old kid can use it
1,its not working unfortunately at first it was reflecting then when i added more items its no longer working it just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created
1,i just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed sectograph on my phone and it says i have to buy pro again what the heck happened with syncing google accounts
1,it wouldnt sync to my google calendar i had it set up and everything
1,very nice app could be very useful but unfortunately does not sync 
1,great idea but doesnt show all events for the day doesnt show events in designated colours all look the same doesnt show repeat events no use really im removing it from my phone
1,this is very good
1,difficult to understand bit complicated
1,no outlook calendar support most business people use outlook
1,not a stand alone app must use calendar on mobile my pout was to use it on its own
1,just an unwanted extension of calendar
1,no use
1,there is no time setting in this graph only dates thats while
1,this program does not work period installed opened just sits there at the start screen frozen and does nothing no available controls or menu nothing do not use it there is nothing to use
1,poor interface
1,hard to use if we could make some changes just by sliding the clock or smthn that would be awesome
1,foolish app steals data doesnt have anything of itself takes everything from google calendar
1,what appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen however the settings doesnt offer that option now its just another app callendar you have to tap to see whats coming up i liked the idea i could just turn on my phone and bang the clock would just simply show me my schedule idk if its a bug or just a false promise either way its disappointing
1,great concept but executed poorly i added 2 events between 630am and 930 but when i tried adding one for 1030am it would let me saying it overlapped with another event which it did not i even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time its now 1142am i tried adding an event for 330pm and it said its saved but hasnt showed on the clock or anything so its pretty useless at this point
1,doesnt sync anymore  i paid for the pro version 
1,didnt like it its connected to the calinder
1,too useless
1,poor settings options i tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive kept getting emails for each task at the time i scheduled it i also got notification popups on my macbook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my google calendar i went to google calendar to turn it off but it wouldnt let me i had to delete all 10 emails hide the notifications and now i will be uninstall this app it should have an option to disable syncing nice idea lazy developers
1,no instructions
1,should have an option to add reminders it only displays events
1,i wanted to like this app its a very convenient way to see all the info i need right on the screen but when i click on the task button i get trapped on the task screen with no way back i have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode
1,no longer work in android 9 it cant load meetings from outlook or even from google accounts interface is badly designed too
1,it only lets you use it linked with google calendar you cant have 2 separate things
1,unable to understand the planner
1,can anyone tell me how to use this app
1,dear developer i have paid the amount for pro version after deduction still app is not get updated to pro version i have mail you the same issue  asked you to look into expecting immediate responce from you
1,looks good but it doesnt sync with events from existing calendars it only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar
1,its too complicated
1,love this app got the pro version it will save a lot of my cognitive work please fix this bug the colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the sub calendar overall the app needs better ux design wrt the complex menu for customization and some other things eg it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars but in terms of functionality it is awesome
1,paid for the pro version but cant keep the changes i make to the settings
1,where is the alarm tone setting in this
1,cool idea but it forces you to use google calendar
1,i dont understand anything its super complicated
1,uninstalled in 5 minutes it didnt populate anything that i had on my calender i even tried to manually put in events and it wouldnt show on widget
1,bestapp ever super useful the only reason for the bad review is because i already paid for the proversion of this app because its that usefulbut its very disappointing this app is not supported by my google watch its not compatible with my ax armani connected smart watch please fix  it would be very useful to see my appointments and errands displayed on my watch without having to open my phone to view than thanks alot ill removed the bad feed back onces its fixed 5 stars
1,doesnt import anything from my calendar despite my calendar being ticked as a source so pretty much pointless im not double entering everything
1,does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics it only shows 24hrs 12hrs in free version very restrictive the widget shows full info for one day and no info ahead unless you select a different day for the days ahead you need to leave the widget and work in a different environment why complicate your life find a calendar app you like stay with it come back to sectograph when and if the widget fully implements time and task management
1,would love this to work it says it is working ticks against my google calendars shows a few doesnt show most disappointing
1,the most complicated routine managing app ever stay away from this one
1,this app is good but the setting is not understandable  i might not even give it a single star
1,wont show events i add to it makes different events random flags or sectors for no particular reason really annoying
1,i wasted my time and money because it doesnt sync to my watch i spent hours trying to get it to work i emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesnt sync to the gears s3
1,demo demo not compatible with outlook
1,took too long to sync uninstalled
1,its a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design
1,did not work on my amazon fire 8 app just flashed abou a mile a minute and nothing could be selected
1,useless app to startwith
1,if you love complex chronographs and a tiny slice of color tells you all then this app is for you this is not a user friendly interface  does not play well with 90 pie but not much does
1,worked fab until recently then i noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when i went into the app it had the time right so i uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when i tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box thats resizable but invisible otherwise very disappointed
1,worked for 2 days now i cant enter anything i enter date time description hit save it says saved but nothing shows up on the lo k dial thingy too bad nice oncept tho
1,debes comprar la aplicación para poder personalizar los colores de los elementos del panel puedes seleccionar y elegir colores pero los cambios no se verán reflejados hasta que compres la aplicación
1,i dont get it in google callender i set a goal to run 430 every morning but why on earth is it so that the app sets time on its own and when i edit it it is edited only for one day not the others
1,the whole app is based on the system calendar appwhen adding showing tasksuse apis but personnalize the design
1,edit reply from developer says sorry if they offended my feelings really this isnt a dispute about feelings to suggest such is a fallacy personal attacks are not welcome when discussing dislike of your pay model original everything is extra 24h mode colors any default functionality will cost you more bad model because they can add and remove features and make you pay again or more let us pay once for the app instead of you being sneaky and greedy
1,edit still doesnt work i suggest adding proper integration with outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of google in terms of usability and ease  before edit doesnt show me the events already listed on my outlook calendar every day is blank when i go to add an event with only outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar i dont care about adding events i can do it on another platform but if cant even see my outlook events then this is useless gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced
1,не работает
1,there is an issue in syncing and the events are lost in few mins post adding it the app could have had their own calendar without syncing to android calendar please improvise
1,not even a trial
1,needs to access data on device events cant be entered manually
1,the app deleted my events and made me late for work today
1,worlds worst appit uses my phones calander
1,i almost tried this when it opened google calendar so i could create a new event im writing this then uninstalling
1,i dont know why i cant seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly when i updated the time to wake up at 730 am but the app keep displaying im to wake up at 630amwhats wrong wasted my time keep trying to update it this is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issuemay seem minor but to me its confusing and thus rendering it less useful tq
1,it shows you all the features very helpful and everything and as a final blow it will tell you that 24 hour widget is only available via in app purchase this is very very misleading for someone who have given their time signed in with google synced their events etc frustrated
1,its not properly work in my phone mi note 5 it always show wedges are not updated i paid last month 99 but it not working
1,the planner does not work well when i set it as every monday it shows different days
1,installed looked like what i was looking for loved the design but the app makes me use the standard alarms and calander of my phone to put every bit of planning in and i hate the calendar on my phone thats why i came here to bad
1,very bad  dont download very complicated app
1,cant access calendar allow access to calendar crashes waiti or close app
1,does not connect with your phones calendar
1,unable to use the widget
1,its pure discriminating to have to buy an extension to be able to use 24hour mode either make it free or let everyone pay for the app i would love to try this app because it really looks like it has a really nice concept but since the devs choose to make just some people pay for it then ill gladly give it a bad review instead
1,unable to see the widget on huawei honor play after adding the widget to my microsoft launcher it does not appear
1,not sure how this app received such high ratings it is just making you add events in your google calendar to create a pie i dont want to add daily tasks to my google calendar i thought this app was going to be more efficient but its not
1,complicated
1,so its just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app it says it does this so you can learn how to use the app but it doesnt allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because its just a demo so its really hard to tell if i like something if i cant do anything on it something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app just saying thanks for wasting my time while im trying to save time
1,this app only connects you with google calendar and thats it not useful
1,how the app is representing there features were not like that  we need to buy them all 
1,fix or give me my money back
1,the wigit doesnt come with the free version it does the same thing your google calendar can do i was looking for something for time blocking  this is time flopping
1,it let me add a couple things to the schedule then when i try to add a reminder to take my daughter to school in the morning and told me there was a conflict deleted everything else still said it had a conflict if i cant easily do the simplest thing it was meant to do i dont have time for it
1,"no user friendly i download this apk for only n only set my full day 
sedual and follow up it everyday but i do not do easy way"
1,"trying to sync to google calendar doesnt work now cant find your email 
address"
1,good but hard to use
1,"for the round watch the program does not go further than demo the check to 
finish demo is out of reach but i like the idea of the program pitty i 
cant use it"
1,it just dont work the way i thought it would not what i expected
1,"always have to go to the calendar annoying and confusing and unnecessary 
pity"
1,"made my phone slow and why to pay money on this app my money has gone and 
no resultwidget is not saving and changingbut idea of this app is gudmy 
money gone"
1,"latest update has made interface unusable in dark mode and does not allow 
users to change the text colour"
1,"i am really sad i saw this a while ago and now i got new watch and cant 
enable it on the watch i just cant find the watch face anywhere"
2,not all calendars are showing up in sync calendar list events created arent appearing
2,isnt easy to use and it tries to sync with my calendar which defeats the purpose of tracking my personal time
2,i hate that its connect to google calendar please make this optional or take it out all together
2,i have not been able to get this app to work i bought the upgraded version and that didnt change any of my abilities to sync calendars right now it gets a 25 stars because it is virtually useless i will update after i reinstall
2,mot sure why but app does not sync with calendar at all
2,does what it says and has a nice calendar sync function but it is a nightmare of visual clutter very difficult to comprehend and use at a glance
2,this might be a good app i didnt get to use it because the only way to use is it is to open it with a calendar app i uninstalled the app because of that reason
2,the most favorite part  add widget to the main screen is unavailable very disappointed
2,i cant see the pie chart style just markers in the begginning and in the end of events
2,dont wanna have to use a second party app just get my schedules on the planner
2,shouldnt be this complicated n it mess up the existing calender events
2,widget out of memory
2,i dont use microsoft or google calendars please integrate with time tree app calendar so i can use your app
2,i hate that you have to use google calander with this i may as well just use google calander looking for a better planner to replace it not exist alongside it uninstalled
2,i had it installed for about a month but didnt find it any easier to use than a normal calendar  in fact i missed a few appointments through using it its surprisingly easy to do that as for some reason it doesnt show the whole day or make it clear which party of the day youre looking at nice idea just doesnt provide the ataglance info i was hoping for
2,at first i liked it so i wanted to unlock the pro features but this can only be done via inapp purchases which means id have to pay over and over again for my family group members to have access to pro i hope the developers consider releasing a separate pro version that can be purchased outright and shared with a family group
2,i love this app i can no longer install it on my wearos watch the app says installing on the wearos play store but never completes please fix this
2,i would like to see it in the lock screen
2,not easy to use quite complicated for just adding a lunch break ect sets events from your calendar might as well use that instead
2,is it possible to use this without connecting it to google calendar
2,i liked the app and i really wanna put better rate but ive got a problem with it it has been an hour since i downloaded ityet i couldnt lay my scadule i wish there is an option to fix the time region cuz when ever i forgot to set the zone to my zone everything is missed up and i have to edit every item again it is frustrating 
2,its just a widget they app description made me think it had a lot more features and dont get me wrong it might be the best widget ive seen for my calendar i really think that the description sets the wrong expectations
2,didnt inform me no alerts deleted on the first day
2,this was a great idea in theory but i want a standalone app that doesnt pull calendar data from some other app for me and for how i wanted to use this app to manage my schedule this just wont work i think it could also be more userfriendly a shame since this really is an amazing unique idea devs i hope you keep working on this and take this as constructive criticism i would love to try this app again if things change and it becomes a more flexible standalone calendar
2,wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar i wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible disappointing
2,it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want to much work not worth it
2,very complex ui it needs google calendar and doesnt work without it i needed a app like this but as a daily planner not just showing the calendar events from google calendar stupidly on a clock
2,the widget doesnt auto update after i add an event always need to click the manual refresh button same goes for when i delete an event
2,cant sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me im not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar pointless
2,i have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year this is a fantastic app however it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars for example if i have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in google calendar the events will not be synchronized with sectograph this would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application however subscribedoutlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu
2,ok good to know thanks it still wont show all of my calendar items on the clock ill put some on and it will take them off as i add more
2,it was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesnt work its not syncing with my calendars im losing dates appointments
2,after last update the widget became very small and clicking on it does not open up the full app also wont sync to my calendar anymore uninstalling
2,wish it didnt force me to use google calendar i wanted to start a new calender off of this app
2,dont know how to use
2,this is exactly the app i was looking for to visual my day as the clock face just makes sense however only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable i tried to use it to better manage my routine but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that i was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance it has amazing potential but is currently only good for basic planning very disappointing
2,it just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events
2,events wont show up on the clock after i adjust the time of the event they show up and then i change the time and they disappear so so frustrating  i wanted to save time not waste it  why why    why    i used this app for 5 minutes and then hit a roadblock why
2,no adding option for the time
2,great idea in principle but its so hard to work out whats going on that that so far its useless 
2,im going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths thats not standard and just annoying second why cant i add events from the app it always redirects to google calendar so what is this app even good for ill just use my calendar and it will be easier
2,was working fine before  but its not working nownot registering my events
2,i really like how amazing it is on my phone but im so disappointed to see that it cant be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch
2,sync is not good
2,cool concept but unusable for google business users because all of your coworkers calendars are selected by default and theres no bulk deselect all button
2,it dont have alarm feature
2,i have problem with purchasing the pro version when i click on buy pro button it says already purchased please restart the app i have not yet purchased it though and nothing happens when i restart the app
2,never tried it yet
2,certain of the event doesnt show up in the clock just recorded in my calender
2,not in sync with my google account bad in regards to automatically getting what i planned and plus i cant use it when i am using my pc but thumbs up for this sectogragh the idea is brilliant please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to reenter all my days task and activities it should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on pc pc is really perfect use for this kind of app
2,this app doesnt seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account ps in my google calendar the desired calendar has got sync enabled still the issue exists ps 2 in the my calenders menu it is not even showing the second calender which i have made for the same google account
2,not that good after using
2,it does not ync eith al the calendars
2,i downloaded it but dont know how to use it really messed up app
2,it good and useful app
2,this app was exactly what i was looking for a visual of the day in clock form only issue is if i add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar i dont want that i want an app where the calendar and app are separate this was supposed to be for studying and exercise i didnt want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar it was a fast uninstall iif there was an option to disconnect the two id reinstall
2,no option for reminders it doesnt show reminders of my google calendar and i dont wanna create events for my daily habits lol
2,im just not finding time to work with this app so by no means the star rank im giving the apl is just a temp ranking
2,i love the ideia but the executation is not good i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone this need a every day reminder routine and stuff
2,the widget is feezing after every night
2,couldnt change time zone its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone
2,does not show reminders
2,correct idea worng execution the watch face ui cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands the time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr i wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes i did give necessary permission phone  one plus 7 os build oxygen os 955 gm57aa further action uninstalling outlook would like to try it post improvement
2,i dont like that it only works with calendar i dont want a calendar even called sleep just to keep it on the graph
2,couldnt exactly figure out how to use it
2,the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it very annoying
2,not a fan  liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder  daily i started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for ie 7pm i mean what about task i have for this day ahead i dont need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine  seriously
2,when adding a task it transferring you to google calendar then after adding the event it doesnt appear on the widget
2,not a single event appointment meeting etcis showing up going to uninstall after rating
2,the app itself is really nice i like how the widget displays my schedule for the day itgives me a very nice grasp of my time the bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone i have a s9 and it drains a lot of battery it makes my phone lag and stutter when i try to open it i uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories so i uninstalled this one the phone was doing so much better and i even paid for the pro version
2,i granted this app full access to my google calendar but none of my events show up in the diagram it remains completely empty except for national holidays like national tartan day on april 6th yay ive given this two stars instead of one because this could be awesome the design is great
2,updated i want to love this but like others have said it doesnt work with all calendars as claimed to get outlook or any other calendar to work you have to have your calendar sync with google which not everyone wants or can do it also only works with googles smart watch not android wear os smart watches great look and idea but very limited by being google only
2,acceptable
2,not exactly useful was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable
2,doesnt sync to my smartwatch 
2,hello team i am not able to set different colours for different sectors could you please help me show how its done i purchased your app in light that it will give me option for above
2,tutorial did not explain much and too confusing to figure out the benefit of using this app
2,otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours very disappointed  you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated
2,it would be a great app if it had an option to use it without syncing it to your calendar like timetune i dont want all my tasks to show up on my calendar and their solution wasnt working
2,useful for organizing the activities of the day but dont have setting on sound to notify the time of activity
2,i like this app but its always saying it has stopped on my phone
2,theres no simple reminders or ability to add to do task everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating meapp is useless right now
2,hi i can add just 1 event why i try to add more in google calendar it shown but in this app its not show up
2,too confusing not neat
2,really beautiful and great idea it is unfortunate for anyone who doesnt buy into all things google and dont use google callander in this day building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless its for the iphone now if i could get my work calendar on this app wow what a great way to visualize your day just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style
2,no graph showing  shows the task sector on phone app but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted
2,once installed the app was showing another time zone
2,doesnt let you choose specific calendar events to ignore no way to track how you actually spent your time if it didnt match your calendar
2,this app doesnt show all the activities of my google calender so to me the app is quite useless i even checked all the available calendars to make sure the settings were right however the concept seems to be great for people with a busy agenda but since it has no use i unfortunately had to delete this app
2,i loved this app but after the new update i am unable to use the widget uninstalled
2,it only works when linked to another calendar appand its difficult to change the time from am to pm
2,couldnt get the rest of my calendars to appear feedback help wasnt clear as well uninstalling
2,i like the idea but its not working with outlook calendar properly this a big drawback for me
2,does not sync with ms exchange calendar
2,"i got this thinking i could use it as a gear 2 watch face its a cool idea 
but would be much better if i could use it on my gear 2"
2,pllllzzzzz make it for ios also
2,very confusing when problems occur the resolution isnt made clear
2,"beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however i wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick update no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed uptoo bad i loved it"
2,"the app is fine but the widget never became available on my phone or watch 
the widget was the whole reason i used this app"
2,"even after entering an event into the app it is not displaying on the 
clock face and it says no events whats the point of the app when it 
doesnt do what it says it can"
2,"doesnt work on my asus zenfone 5 ze620kl it doesnt show up whenever i 
add the widget in my home screen"
2,im sure it would be great if it didnt pick and chose what events to display from my calendar i have multiple events logged in my calendar the only calendar its synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on yet just one of them shows up it has a lovely design but that doesnt mean anything when the app doesnt actually work for what its intended for
2,to complicated and lets you set things up only to then tell u its not available
2,in my last phone asus zenfone c i can use this app well but after i changed my phone to samsung j7 2016 it automatically connects with either samsung or google calendar where i cant edit the event colors freely on the clock im very disappointed so i had to uninstall sorry
2,i couldnt sync this with my work email and doesnt seem to give me the option to
2,cant adjust center clock size cant open alarms by touching the center clock the image for opening the app on the play store doesnt represent what you can customize the clock to look like as a widget augh cool but lacking necessary functions  edit  i was not able to click the center clock and open my alarms not sure why but the developer said it is possible
2,could not get app to consistently stay connected to my google calendars
2,i love the idea but there are syncing issues  events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar  they show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same  also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day  i have something starting at 1230 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else  its confusing
2,just works with google calendar cant use it without it uninstalled
2,not working properly on redmi note 4
2,good app missing vital a feature  it shows meetings not being attended ie going  no  that is an obvious feature that stops me from giving a good rating i must keep company meetings in the calendar that im not attending for posterity  not unreasonable i think so this is a must
2,the only thing that is missing is to open specified event after click on a widget for now i can give for stars ill give more when this feature will be available   edit after upgrade adding widget to homescreen only allocates place but is invisible when it finally showed up it doesnt have promissed functionality
2,i couldnt understand it probably my fault but i find it complicate and i like to organize my day like without go and add on my calender just on this app but like i said its probably my fault  gonna try this app again later maybe like after couple of different updates
2,the idea is amazing and its useful except it stop workingcant show its widget after update
2,how does it work 
2,it doesnt show reminders not much useful without reminder display  support
2,it displays awkwardly has backwards date malfunctions to a point where the widget does not display has a small central area has no 1x1 option has complicated descriptions for functionality that should be easy to understand but i can buy a widget pallet which many apps have as standard for free for 3 whats not to love
2,24 hrs shouldnt be extra cost cant import from my google calendar and too many left and right arrows confusing too few colours for the sectors
2,it could be a very useful app but it is not very intuitive why should i set up the date in google calendar and not directly in the app
2,interesting idea but useless
2,i was expecting it to sync google reminders also from google calender i use them a lot it has so much to do but since it cannot sync reminders like how it does for events its not what i am looking for
2,the widget doesnt update with the system time often stuck until i interact with it greatly impacting usability i have locked the app to not be closed in recents and a fix to this issue will change my rating    i did pay to customize the clock face and its far better than the default choices though
2,it was a great app but after todays update i am finding few menu items in some other language even after setting the default language to english it is not helping team please help
2,does not show morning events
2,the entire rating goes to the ui widget does not refresh with time which makes it pretty useless
2,interesting just not for me
2,purchased app palette when i try to use it app stops every time
2,great idea very slick but when some appointments appear and some dont  when added correctly from inside the app with add events there is something wrong can see them on the calendar but not on the widget
2,no way to change the font size so most of my events just display as meeting wi which is basically useless cant even click on the event to see i have to go to a different calendar app to see what i have to do which is the one thing a calendar widget should do for you  edit in response to the creators response to my comment it is important to keep in mind that this is a free app with no possibility to upgrade meaning this is not a professionallydeveloped app so there should be no guarantee or expectation of quality so if what youre looking for is a free app then this might be a good app for you however if youre looking for a calendaragenda app then probably not
2,im not digging the new widget design i dont like the time in the middle now and i hate having to touch the little icon it was better when you could just touch the main part of the widget
2,love the idea however i use outlook calendars for lots of things and this only works with google calendar 
2,it is a solid idea but the widget does not work properly anymore on my lg v10 it either does not load it properly or it loads it properly but the clock will not update any help
2,need more customisation in widgets font colour and others clock in the widget is not working properly sometimes clock stuck on that time i need to open the app ill download it if you fix that
2,graphics
2,doesnt seem to work on samsung note 2
2,nice idea but if you have busy scedual it is not clear enough all meetings are in the same color it is problematic specialy if you have overlaps meetings
2,i have tried to sync it to my google calender account but i am unsuccessful if anyone is able to point me in the right direction please
2,may be good for you but i cant comment further
2,like many others i find it too small would replace 12 hours with this if the option to increase the size was added edit just noticed the last update was 3 years ago so guessing this wont happen
3,is there a way to set times without syncing if i set a daily morning task for example then it will clutter my other calendars with that task if theres no way to set it so that i can do daily time schedules without clutter then itll have to be 3 from me
3,i deleted it i dont want to use my calendar
3,good getting to know
3,thank you for such a gud sectograph this is so nice and perfect but i want the alarm should ring louderto adjust but its not available i think if its there pls let me know how to adjust the volume
3,google  drive app intrall
3,good but unless you pay you cant enjoy the good stuff
3,very useful app but need alram feature too
3,nice even cute but it turns out i dont use it so much cause it uses my private google calendar
3,i like this app but would like to see future dates to see any conflicts in schedule would be nice to have some font size selection in widget no matter how big you make the widget it can be hard to read for those with less than perfect vision
3,dont like that i can only add items through the calendar i dont put everything on the calendar thats on my todo list
3,really good idea clearly shows whats coming up in my day and helps me manage my time the one thing that winds me up with it is how it fades into the next clockface i decided to pay for the app to have he 24hr clock display and i would much prefer if the display changed at midnight rather than partially showing tomorrow and partially showing today its really confusing to look at and makes it difficult to visualise the day as a whole the lack of this option feels like an oversight
3,i really really enjoyed the app but i have a few problems first pls make it so we can add daily routines bcs some stuff i have to do daily like take medicine or drink a cup of cold water and its tiring to have to add this every single day so pls add the daily feature second every time i need to add an event i need to go to the calendar and add it there so i literally have to use another app to be able to use this one pls make it so we can add events from the app directly thank youu
3,confusing for me but several friends enjoy it
3,my app doesnt show reminder on the screen previously it was showing which settings shall i change plz guide
3,good but very buggy
3,great in theory doesnt play nice with outlook which is s shame as this could be the next must have app
3,really cool idea but not supported on my wear os fossil watch gen 3 i was able to hack it as a watch face via the wearable widgets app but its not optimized please add watch face support for fossil wear os devices
3,yeah
3,would give a 5 star if it worked on my galaxy watch need more detailed instructions cant find it on my watch
3,is this have an alarm mode
3,what if i dont want it to use internal calendar
3,this is actually really useful given the kind of arrangement they chose  showing tasks like the arms of a clock so its really convenient for us to know  at what time which tasks are there to complete but the problem is that when there are more than one task at the same time the texts superimpose on each othr and we cant read thm considering they use google calender to set up the tasks i feel like google calender itself  its widget is more useful than this but 55 for user interface
3,howd u adjust an event duration 
3,this app look cool on the screen but it was hard to figure out how to use it the could be more settings added to the app so people can make it more direct for their life
3,hey will there be no reminder function on this app
3,one of the main bugs in this app is that the widgets time doesnt update on its own and the time gets stuck at any point
3,this app would be so amazing if you add  repeat weekly2 weeks  feature  we would then be able to use it as a time table  please 
3,i wanted to use this apps independently of calendar the apps is well done but it comes as a doublon of calendar and it become not useful for me
3,downloaded yesterday and was pleased by the overall design im willing to pay the app for the full customisation however the app doesnt sync with my google calendars reminders and tasks which what i use the most instead of events which only this app allows hope this could be improved
3,it worked fine but after android 9 latest updates it fails to update the widget and have to open the app to do the same
3,its been good cant complain
3,drain too much my battery
3,its good but not that much because after completing the tasks they didnt appear in the list it must be in one frame at a place down in the list  secondly it doesnt provide u the notifications properly it just ring like a bell that is for a single second
3,still learning to use app
3,almost excellent app unfortunately and surprisingly its missing outlook integration so ill use something else meanwhile
3,usable
3,is it possible to use the widget on my samsung active 2 watch if so then how
3,quite complicated need simplification and please remove date from the daily routine planner just make ui more user friendly and for your response and consideration 2 more stars 
3,what is this  next alarm sysyem update
3,average app
3,it is good but you should add some predefined themes in the palette and not only allow the user experiment
3,confusing without a lot of explanation on what is what might be good when i figure it out but its not a real intuitive app and has a figure it out curve
3,i love this app  the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors also ive found the colors are very limited when it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events it gets it wrong or doesnt have the color
3,good idea but there is on reapeat routine i have to add evertime so make me hang more and its work only 12 hours basis
3,felt very complicated when i am flying high
3,this just displays your calendar as a time sector whenever you click on  it redirects to calendar
3,limited use so far every time i i touch the calendar icon the app changes to calendar but will not revert back to watch face unless i uninstall and reinstall no back button
3,lot of difficult methods to organize
3,best app to mannage your time
3,not able to open events into another calender app it always opens events in my native mobile calender app
3,i like this app a lot it is refreshing but to be 5 stars i should have more flexibility in setting intervals like selecting days of the week so i can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat when i add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default im using the app to plan my day primarily finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entrys end time with the new end time shortly after say 30 min later that would be a 5 star app
3,it is useful but very user friendly
3,its a cool way of getting at a glance your schedule the theme could be more colorful
3,great app and well thought of love the wear os integration however paying for the full version i wish there was more customizable options such as custom background or custom font for the numbers would be great to include that
3,good idea but i cannot connect it with my smartwatch
3,well this is awkward but i cant even find widget option for this app in phone downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version i believe the whole purpose was to have a clock on my homescreen that has my calender synced it doesnt seem to that may be im missing something here ill definite give an update of this review if i can figured it out
3,pretty app and probably useful too i just dont like having to create calendar entries i thought tasks would be managed within the app
3,seems like a good idea but the widget is invisible it is there i can see the edges when i try to move it but its completely invisible i tried decreasing the widget transparency and deleting cache but to no avail devs any clues thank you
3,when i first downloaded this app i loved it i enjoyed being able to see my day at a glance and everything was working fine for some reason the widget will not open the app for me anymore and i have no idea how to fix it i tried to uninstall the app and install it again and it still doesnt work anybody has any suggestions im open to them i use an android just to clarify the app itself is still working the widget is not
3,not sure yetstill testing it
3,we need an update i love this app and use it daily but the fact that we havent had an update in months bothers me here are some suggestions i have add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task i use 45 min more color options for tasks an option to change the notification sounds for each entry a push all back an hour option and more widget options thank you i love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades
3,it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial
3,i dont friggin know yet i just installed it note i havent spent any time on it
3,the app is really useful one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time unless we dont refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget if you can solve this this is one of the best app for daily use and surely youll get more pro version users of this app thank you
3,seemed like a good app but doesnt always show your plans its linked to my calender and ive added quite a few things for the month but it only shows on this app once and then disappears next time i look at it
3,i do not understand how i will add events i tried adding events but it only shows up in my calendar not at the sectograph it seems to be useful but i need to know how to make it work
3,im liking it but it seems to have some bugs its currently 0113am but the widget and app are still showing yesterdays calendar sectors and event list
3,just a fancy calender widget sure it looks fancy but it doesnt add any functionality it cant do much else it cant track progress
3,i love the design and the app in general i would give it 5 stars if it would allow to size the image and the information displayed
3,everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app
3,too tricky complicated not immediate maybe isnt what i needi need something more simple
3,works well until you purchase pro after this all your calendar dates are displayed one day ahead your events on a monday in your calendar are displayed on sunday
3,the time in the center of the widget most of the time does not get updated you have to open the app and then the widget is updated
3,it doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series so if i want to block off an hour every day for the same thing but then i have to schedule a oneoff thing during that time i cant just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone i love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app
3,good app but need improvement
3,its a nice app liked the design also no option to copy paste same schedule to next day
3,this is a good planner because its easy to use and understand but the widget consumes a lot of the phones battery
3,the app work just fine it was my commitment that had problem 
3,still trying
3,got this loved the free version paid 399 for pro and still dont have the ability or cant figure out how and there are no instructions to set different calendars on two widgets on my phone ill be happy to give you 5 stars if you send me a howto also it says there is time tracking does that mean i should be able to do a startstop on something while im doing an activity
3,average features
3,its pretty neat i love the how everything pops out on the clock only thing is i tried scheduling things after 12 pm and it wouldnt pop up and i notice it only shows 12 hours at a time if you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature which i think is totally worth it seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything
3,nice but there seems to be no way to hide declined events that makes it much less useful would give 55 otherwise
3,it just opens acalender so im not sure why i need something between me and my regular calendar app
3,nice app i just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie 35 30 735 30 835 30 835 it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious how can i remove these update to reply thank you but i am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use can this function be disabled
3,i uninstalled because the app was a little confusing it has a great idea and all bit i just didnt quite get how to use it
3,great app just need one thing is second hand also like minutes and hours the i will 5 star and its best app
3,updated was confused that the event list in the actual app wasnt showing events scheduled for the next few days the widget will only show events in the next 12h the event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h i think this list should list events for that entire day this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view
3,needed a standalone platform which does not connect to any of my calendars
3,seems good but i would need admin approval to access my work outlook calendar so its pretty unusable for me
3,really great concept but not much useful and not even that beautifully eyecatching thing
3,i really like the visual round of this app however i would love to be able to personalise it more easily
3,it s good
3,good so far only used a few times may review later on
3,sometimes it shows wrong time make me confused most of the time
3,its an interesting tool but having one or 2 things on my calendar per day it does really make sense for me to use it looks nice
3,i dont like to put on google calendar every schedule
3,app is great but the events are not getting created  only one two events for a day is created than even it shows created its not
3,added feature synchronizer connect added the note writing feature during the call added a feature synchronized with the mail
3,i wouldve liked to use this app but sadly it doesnt seem to recognize european daylight saving time ive gone through the settings twice this is a deal breaker im afraid i would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where dst is rightfully ignored the main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed 
3,wish i could add events without having anything to do with google calendar
3,cant get demo to play its probably a great app
3,looks cool but i do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day
3,sorry i dont get it i have no idea why seeing my schedule on a circle is somehow better than a rectangle what am i missing
3,it would be much better with an ability to have a report at the end of the month as to what was worked on and when ie statistics
3,can you make this app a separated planner and can make an event without using calendar i really like this app but i want this app as my daily task organizer and my calendar as a big event organizer so it wont jumble up in my calendar
3,okk
3,hi the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events it had been the best reason why i chose this app to have an easy straightforward overview of my plans why doesnt ut work as it is shown on the pictures
3,i really have wanted this app to work id really prefer to see my day filled on a clock in such a way so i even came back to try again however im having trouble putting tasks in after a certain amount they stop saving im also struggling to see the clock in a way that makes sense it looks very jumbled best of luck i love the concept
3,good app but needs to add daily to do list
3,i had to pay for the option to change the colours then i had to pay more to customise it further exploitative money grabbing like this ensures ill never recommend it to anyone else works well though
3,a little confusing at first but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar like if you add eat breakfast itll go on your calendar so thats only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read but besides that it works well
3,this is a great app but i purchased it to be able to use it with my samsung gear s3 little did i know that i cant use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear which i found out later my bad so will you be working on making this app compatible with samsung gear that would open your market quite a lot with samsung gear users ive been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesnt work smoothly at all please work on that if you can thanks
3,good app but had to uninstall kept adding reminders to all off my tasks and scheduled events even when repeatedly deselecting them very frustrating and inconvenient to get the notification and the email notification
3,time zones not supported missed a meeting today 
3,not as i required
3,its db un to use
3,is the feature of different colours for different tasks available for the free version too  i m actually not able to set it that way no sir i did the way u told me to do it is still not showing different colours
3,i have changed my mind and have bought the 24hr clock version once the app is fully updated and is working how i want it to use i will review accordingly i have gave 3 stars as it is the middle ground for now
3,for 24 hour version need to buy app no free trials
3,fine
3,i would give this 5 stars if not for the misleading inapp smartwatch settings extension purchase option i love the app but i purchased the extension to use it on my galaxy watch and i have been unable to connect it to my watch and use any of the settings for a wearable if this app can be used on the galaxy smartwatches i would love to know how
3,nice visualization of personal activities
3,ok but need to improve
3,so far its working for me i needed something that could ring or vibrate
3,still want to go thoroughly with this app
3,any way to resize font so short events can still have a complete or at least longer than 2 words display
3,cool idea woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar
3,it would have been better if it kept its own database rather than relying on the calendar i dont want to put trivial things to plan my day in my calendar uninstalling
3,impressivecould be better if it had its inbuilt calendar which is linked with events of google calendar it should also have to do list with with alertsa weekly plannerthia will make it perfect
3,havent used it enough to truly rate it but it just seems like there could be some big innovation if you put more thought into it a lot of potential if you ask me though
3,pls add 24 hour view
3,its great i love it
3,recommend
3,if you want something that syncs to your calendar you are in luck it really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea however my 3 star review comes from the fact you cant use it without syncing to your calendar and there by having it affect your calendar i was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool much like a block system but i cant have it be that and have my calendar be a place for just appointments it makes the actual calendar look too full and messy basically in short can you please add an offline tool as well
3,after the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are been using the app for more than a year now and love it
3,it dont work with samsung gear s3 smart watch even after i bought tge widget
4,love it great time management app one thing i think would be great is if you guys would add a feature where it shows like a chart of all your time from the past say like past year so you can see where you are spending your time cumulatively instead of just the chart of how you spend your time each day which is still super helpful but adding a chart of how you spent your time in the past would be great would love to see that feature perhaps on an update of the app
4,how do i see all events and other day events instead of only today within 12h only is this what you mean by 24h clock in pro will it also show other days with pro i like the app but some things ar not very clear to me thanks
4,great app love the layout
4,epic but when i go to a later date like my future birthday 21st may 2021 and i touch the hand of the clock to slide it it takes me back to 21st of may 2020 why does this happen
4,the clockface schedule calendar i was looking for however since last update clicking on event on the widget doesnt enlarge the event so i couldnt see details unless i open it in the calendar
4,i dont usually do reviews but this app is honestly quite great it really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when i open to my home screen my only complaint is that it does end up crowding my calendar app because it requires you to add an event to the calendar but past that its pretty great most planner apps dont work but this blew it out of the park
4,wish it could sync with google task  
4,saya bisa manage waktu saya mantep tp harga pro mahal nih diskon dong
4,its good app to use
4,i really liked the concept of the diagram as thats exactly what i was looking for the only drawback for me is that it takes the events from the settingsandroid calendar which is not what i wanted i would prefer to set events in the app straightaway i will download it again if this feature becomes available in the future 
4,i bought the pro version its a really great app simple clock widget to display all my plans for the day i used it on my smart watch n its really useful i dont know if its a bug or not but when i touch the event on the phone widget and it shows the detail after that when i touch the x button it wont go back to the clock face but open the calendar instead and i cant move the watch hands around to see the othe upcoming events i hope therell be update about these thanks alot
4,very nice app any chance tasks and reminders can be integrated into the display as well
4,extremely helpful for a visual thinker like me but the pallette settings are confusing and should be the same for all watch faces having different colors in the app and in the widget and on the watch face is distracting and confusing
4,works for me so far like it
4,its really great app and per partner for daytoday life im giving only 4  star because while selecting any sector time some time it shows different option or sometime it shows correct option but giving another time sector information
4,not very easy to navigate the settings
4,love this app i have always thought of time on a clock face and this just makes so much more sense to me than the list of things you get in google calendar and other organisational apps my only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment events and the option to link a segment to a checklist i have found a way to do this but it means i need to use a url link to redirect it to said list and that takes an extra click and is a bit fiddly to set up
4,great app love how it learns abt my events and notifies me accordingly
4,its an amazing app it shows us how much time we take for homeworks and etc this is really useful app for me hope you get the same experience
4,i recommended this app to everyone because its very useful app especially for students like me
4,great app it is working very well for our family in planning our days would like for it to fully interface with my calendar though  so i could edit from sectograph as well otherwise i think it is an excellent way to spatially visualize time management
4,there is a delay in updating but apart from that a fine app
4,ive always viewed time as a spiral so this fits perfect to keep me visually organized the app is very clever fading out old events while revealing new ones for the next time around the face everything is customizable allowing you to make it look exactly like you need it the only thing i want that would bump this to 5 stars is in app alarms i dont like relying on the calendars little onetime beeps allowing me to set an actual alarm i have to silence would be great
4,good to have this as my memo
4,very good app helped me a lot
4,synchronisation is not happening i wailt for 6 hours and hit sync icon many times but it will not appear all events added in google calendar
4,just started to use this app seems helpful so far
4,1add feature to copy created event to add them further in the schedule repeatedly without hassle manually entering each event must end its a waste of time 2a feature such that just by rotating the dial of the watch by finger we can make next event in the schedule eg we select duration we click on okay and then we add title to the event to create there task 3 an option to switch between weather we want new start time for the event or just continue with finish time of the last event
4,you asked me if i would recommend it its a cool app i like the simplicity of my other calendar a little better i know of another cool device i call it a lev drive interested yes its just theory for now
4,useful easy to visualizer whats upcoming and plan my day just a pity not able to track my actual time spent to see where my time went so im also looking at time tracking app while using this as a scheduler review thing
4,helpful
4,good but confusing for new user
4,smart app help your organised your daily tasks
4,im using a free version and it works very well keeps me up to date
4,this is neat i like seeing my appointments displayed like this wish there were color theme options for the free version
4,the app is ok pretty useful and featurepacked before its usable though you have to spend a minimum of an hour to set it up the ui is soso too
4,recommend to try it 4 starts as nothing is perfect not because it isnt good enough
4,good step learning curve
4,how can i change the notification sound 
4,does exactly what it said it would
4,ive been using the app for quite a while and it seems to work well with google calendar showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs while i have not experienced any issues and the widget is a musthave on my home screen customisation options are very limited for free users thats not a big deal but i do wish we had at least a bit more
4,i like this app if it can sync easily and automatically without delay i will give it 5 stars
4,very nice and innovative calander app only one thing is multiple widget like squre and rectangle also widget event font was very small there should be option to increase font size to proper visibilityalso it show next event instead of curren event thanks
4,good apk
4,great really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time wish the interphase was more customizable tho
4,i love this app i just wish that there was an internal calendar in it so that i didnt have to create and turn on a calendar in google calendars in order to receive alerts for events in sectograph
4,im still looking forward to its impacts at this point
4,excelente aplicação boa integração com google calendar e facilita a gestão do dia e da semana parabéns aos desenvolvedores
4,im still trying to figure out all out im unsure if i want to buy the upgrade but i like the idea of it
4,work well as my need except it can not be watch face on samsung watch i try it several days and love it so i purchase the pro version wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with android i didnt know that samsung watch is different os so its incompatible  however the developer show responsibility by refunding the money anyway i still hope it will be able to use with samsung watch soon keep up the good work
4,really like this app
4,i am using the paid version and this is really good love it quick questioni want to integrate this with the samsung smart watch is this possible otherwise deserves 5 stars please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors
4,interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity lets manage it as it should 
4,like the latest updates thanks
4,an excellent time keeping tool would it be possible to have a separate 12hour widget and another 24hour widget and it seems that the manual update button in the home screen widget is not working for microsoft outlook
4,if alarm connected will be the best one
4,i like the concept and the free version is passable but it seems like a lot of features are locked behind the pay version i may end up purchasing not sure yet
4,glitches with all day events in outlook
4,it is a great app buy there are some problems your widget mostly do not sync automatically with my phones clock so eventually i have to open the app and set the widget to match the clock please fix this thank you very much
4,i used to have this as my default watch face but lately i cant put this on my android wear device maybe my ticwatch is too old for the latest version but it used to be the best does anyone know how to put this watchface on their android wear if it doesnt show up automatically
4,love this app all time basedentire day events in visually streamlined view
4,very nice app except saving everything to my calandar
4,lets me see my schedule visually neat
4,very close to being 5 stars there are just a few oddities in the user interface and possibly slight inconsistencies on what the app is doing who means that for some the word buggy might be applied im more inclined to say unpolished in certain areas but a great app none the less
4,its ok but i cant put the clock onto my home screen
4,its good can still be improved looking forward to it
4,its really smart idea to see at a glance from your homescreen all your planned activities
4,very nice app but 1 reminders are not showing in the app 2 all day events start from 12 in the app which makes them less readable when there are many all day events so better make it customizable
4,this is good app and it has a beutiful widget
4,nice layout
4,easy to use love the format and widget format as well works perfect for my frienfs business that i work for i can help him get and stay organized and were less likely to forget important things i love how i can organize the scedule and set reminders while im at home relaxing and he can instantly have it on his phone as well barely any adds which is awesome great app for what i use it for and im sure it can be great for alot of different situations 
4,its really a great app to organize your life good experience 
4,i love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable 
4,one of the best productivity apps on the play store i had recently purchased the app to customize the widget and colors but find it difficult because it could not load the existing wallpaper i am using on the preview it is also hard to try and mix different colors to see it would be best to have the customization be seen real time rather than pick and see color thank you
4,great app detailed yet concise with only the information i need amazingly it is packaged together with one app so effectively
4,its really a good appbut they need to add some more features to it like copy schedule and some other good features
4,i would like to buy the program but i do wish to use a different address
4,good app but i cant get it to shade in the entire timeframes of my activities like in the photos here it only has a line at the end time
4,love love love this app but you guys can add some more features to make it a bit more easier to use
4,this is seriously good and so far it has worked flawlessly just that sometimes it takes a bit of time to update the calendar entry on the app but i dont mind
4,good app and so close to what i was looking for but its missing one thing if you could add an option to add your own tasks without it having to be an actual event thatd be awesome i dont want to add wake up or gym as an event in my calendar
4,id say its great
4,good visualisation would be great if the widget came in a dark version as well and transparency could be set
4,this is a good apps but i think it will be better if the widget will show in the lockscreen too so it will be easier to check the plan but offer all this is a good apps still find no problem up till now maybe ill try the premium version to see the more features
4,it is a nice application
4,annoying that you cant change the color background of the dial with the free version but otherwise very useful and fun to use
4,seems good for people who use a calendar already but i hate google calenders and outlook alike i couldnt figure out how to create my schedule without using one of those terrible calendars so i uninstalled
4,really nicely made and very useful app and always a looker for others recently however it always shows some phantom alarm clocks i did not set
4,wish for larger text difficult to read
4,really great but no projecttask relationships that i could find so grouping things is hard except coloring them manually
4,this is good application for the procrastinators who usually wasted their time on phone without any reason i like the sectograph because it let me push to do the work of hat makes any sense so i recommend you to use this application 
4,i like the graphic
4,useful but still needs more integration to outlook  id like to load my colour categories that i already have in outlook calendar in my visualization calendar by week numbers is also a must have  id like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events it could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time i wake up  and so on the potential of this app is huge
4,very good app the only note is that it takes a while to make it syncronizing properly but after you get it works like a charm
4,very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule
4,i like the app widget i wish the center was a lil bigger or bold i havent had an issue withit other than that
4,it takes some getting used to but then when you start thinking of it as an analog watch it sort of works
4,really like it would love to be able to manually resize appointments and add new appointments into arcs with free time
4,enjoying it so far
4,cute love it but bugs no alarms thats the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me
4,good android widget for watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen  for syncing all calenders to view birthdays  events at one place
4,i really like this app i find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your events very useful the one drawback for me is that it doesnt integrate with google tasks or reminders this means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event this is not a massive deal but i do like the convenience of tasks over events the widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time
4,just please add reminders  notifications with custom sound  and more colors  and please make the wedge icon display description of the event or auto degrease the letters size to fit more than 1 word or add a fieldnto type title that will be shownedited in the app even it comes from another planner without titles 
4,love it just need galaxy watch face even paid fair price
4,excellent work
4,best app works perfect but giving 4 stars due to colour settings whenever you try to change colour of tasks there is a problem that you touch a colour and it selects other colour like touch red colour it selects blue this problem is in all colours
4,this is a great app but i dun like it link to my calendar because it will mess them up prefer if this is a standalone calendar so that i can separate my schedule in this app and other schedule in my calendar
4,functional
4,excelente programa me ha ayudado muchísimo y puedo ver de forma gráfica todo lo que debo hacer en el día
4,if u make an app for samsung gear  i would love that
4,classic
4,quite helpful for daily tasks
4,a birds eye view to your schedule
4,its nice and helpful
4,excellent planner
4,app is great overall but unless im missing something obvious i cant seem to put the widget on my home screen
4,its very good
4,how to make the sectograph appear in the home screen
4,the app is real good and helps in improving the productivity an improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar it is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event
4,great app to track your daily schedule one thing what would be great to have here  displaying the scheduled reminders from google calendar unfortunately i do not see them
4,very effective i would give 5 stars but writting space too little larger writting space will help much better
4,really fun view of your day still figuring out how to use it well it would be nice for the widget palette to also be visible inside the app but its not a huge issue i could easily see myself changing to 5 stars once i get used to it
4,it is a good app really ok but i dont like that you oblige me to rate this is a no go
4,nice app quite original
4,it gives a nice visual look at the day
4,good app but not exactly what i was looking for this app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle the controls are great i love when i move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing love the widget i wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule i ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one i was able to change the colors of each event in the app very easy to use overall
4,very good well its a great app i just wish we had more free features it would be a rmgrest investment
4,needs improvement
4,its a neat app
4,you can add one thing when well touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed
4,good app but need to something more
4,very good app helps me stay organized
4,nice app but not able to use widget nokia 21  android pie
4,overall impressive app but it does not updated in real time always showing delayed time until manual update
4,i really like the app its pretty cool how do i get the 24 hr clock on my android wear 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch 
4,i started using this app in 11th std  im getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour so i humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably
4,neat but i dont put that much stuff on my calendar looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines dont want to add all that stuff to my calendar
4,now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out however would think should see them in overall list but not on widgetgood but could be just tad better
4,it took me a while to understand how to use certain features but once i did i found it to be exactly what i needed if google would allow reminders to come through it would be the perfect time management tool my only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for like when im changing the color scheme i cant always tell whats what for those not wanting their calendar clogged up just make those things hidden after youve added them
4,thanks to you this app makes me more concentrated and schedulable in my days and its efficient visual time widget on the home screen is really practical but sync between calendar and app is a little timeconsuming
4,this app is very helpful but you need to control yourself to done schedule on time
4,i like it also i would like like a wedget but for the block screen then you dont need to open the phone only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar
4,ótimo o app porém ele é meio que um relógio de estudo que marcar cada segundo
4,its your calendar on a clock best if you have a smart watchi dont but still a great app if your a visual person 5 star if i ever get a smart watch
4,lot more easy and practical maintaining calendar is funloved the widget
4,best watch once you understand it it takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually get it but once you do it does exactly what it promises its sleek yet informative and by far the best at a glance app for your homescreen the watch addon is the cherry on the cake only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance
4,i love this widget its such a clear picture of the time and schedule my only thing is i wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch i got the app because i saw it on the watch im the pictures but it doesnt work with the galaxy watch  if this was improved to work with the watch i would give it 5 stars
4,تطبيق جميل ويساعد حقا
4,this is so helpful i use this with the forest app to stay on task you can add different calenders from google and keep work and personal separate
4,really good
4,good application 
4,é um aplicativo pra quem é visual se você ê mais chegado a listas não recomendo o uso mas é um aplicativo muito bom para ver seu tempo livre e o tempo que você gasta com tarefas relacionadas a eventos
4,a great tool to see whats going on in your day i linked work and personal calendars into one the customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to
4,i think its pretty cool how this app communicate with the calender smart watch greatly enhanced the experience as well good job i just wish there was a galaxy watch version of it 
4,very helpful for busy scheduled hard workers
4,cool app can almost replace the other widgets i have on my home screen but missing one feature which is not the fault of the app but a shortcoming for my particular needs weather include weather and i can easily pay for this app still keeping as it is a good app
4,doesnt support fossil sport watch anymore
4,nice app but havent been able to explore its full potential
4,its a good tool
4,doesnt really sync with my calendar as events are added edit user error with delay in google calendar
4,good visual representation of my daily schedule and todo list a great way to remain mindful of how time is spent during the day
4,a very good pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side im not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today my whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45 looking as faded blue and nothing else was there i also have screen shot of the error if developers need it else its a great app soon will buy the pro version
4,its great app  it should be complete free but of course nor maybe few updates than ill rate 5
4,very useful syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks
4,i used to be able to tap on the widget and it opened but now it doesnt whats the point of the widget if it doesnt open was able to quickly fix in the settings thanks for the comment
4,beautiful
4,i bought the pro version and like it so far for now what im really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself with the left and right arrows and not only from inside the app why wouldnt you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself other than that the app seems to be very practical if the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented it would be a 5 star app for me thanks
4,ive been using this app and the watch face on my moto 360 for close to about a year now with all my events for the day and the next day visible on my wrist i can keep track of my calendar easily however recently the watch face is defaulting to simple clock default watch face whenever i use the watch it only affects sectograph and it has been bugging me since
4,unable to tap widget to open app and open calender since update thank you for response sorted
4,it is better to have more choices in time repeat like i want do some jobs in some days of week wendsday sunday and monday
4,its good for me and it really helpful
4,it is a very helpful app
4,very nice setup thought enough of it to pay for premium couple things  add ability to change watch hand colors arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see  add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time difficult to read watch  ticwatch pro 4g phone  moto z3 wpie
4,need to update the calendar more otherwise perfect
5,this apps widgets cant realtime refresh in new android core 10
5,amazing app one of the main reasons i like having a smart watch is to keep track of my appointments on my wrist and this has been one of if not the best way ive tried of having easy visual access to my daily agenda the visuals is seeing the hand move towards my meetings and the time listed until then is a great touch as well
5,this makes it very easy to get a quick glance and understanding of my schedule i love how it shows how much time is in between and before an appointment it makes life easier to plan great visuals too
5,good app i agree with other reviews the addition of tasks will make it great update the new edition seems to be less useful it seems one need the pro version to get it to work well revised update the app is very useful to ser in one vie appointments highly recommended
5,good for those who work well with visual prompts
5,its nice to see the day at a glance
5,it thinks about the day the way i do
5,best time planner

5,i bought the full version and i am quite gappy with it its a cheap onetime purchase and it gives you a bunch of extra features
5,loved it but keep improving and make brilliant experiences for customer

5,most of my issues with this are due to google tasks not syncing with google calendar on android although i do believe they are testing rollout of that by region makes my day feel like a majoras mask adventure and really multiplies my concentration an absolute musthave
5,this app is exactly what i was looking for and its really well made i soon decided to buy the upgrade as i love being able to see 24 hours at a time and being able to switch between that and the 12hour view but thank you so much for making a very good usable app for free as well

5,so helpful
5,i love the unique idea ive used this for my past two phones
5,i really like this app and it is definitely a very nice visual way to keep track of time the one major issue i keep encountering though is that it does not seem to easily sync with my google calendar which is where i have all my daily tasks stored edit after trying a few troubleshooting options including the faq suggestions i was finally able to get sectograph to begin syncing again by uninstalling and reinstalling google calendar it seems like it was a onetime glitch love this app
5,this is perfect for me i find it really easy and quick to use this app and maintain my daily routine also it looks kind of cool on my home screen and the colour coding helps me too i would suggest to add some more colours to choose from
5,i love the concept

5,nice visual way to see tasks coming up the analog format really lets you see how long a meeting or task will take and you can sync with calendars
5,superb routin management
5,it works really from a person who cannot plan and get things done the colors are really helpfull and the graphics make you feel like doing the stuff
5,i love your widget however now with samsung phone i cannot add it under my work profile di you know why is there a workaround thanks

1,it literally just completely stopped working yesterday without me changing anything either in the app or in my settings whenever i add a new event or routine now it just doesnt create it or show me notifications my schedule stays completely blank lmao im sorry but it doesnt even bring up the technical report when i press it
1,the layout was horrible the events and the scheduled items dont sync
1,i have the app set to verbally remind me of schedule events the problem comes when i have my phone set to silent the app supercedes the phone and still verbally reminds me if the phone is on silent its for a reason there seems no way to bypass this this is a severe flaw that needs to be addressed hopefully sooner rather than later
1,all the features are premium 
1,i loved this app so much after i downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks because i loved it so much i decided to purchase the pro full version and payed 499 however it was not worth paying at all i would have rather used the free version with the ads i will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the 499 ad free version because it doesnt really give you anything extra i would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed
1,i was unable to understand anything this app is a big mess
1,doesnt let me add even one item to my day without buying the pro version
1,a hidden wonderful music comment and feedback is correct please do it like previous it was
1,bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it
1,asking to buy pro version when clicked on new program
1,didnt like navigation menu location update
1,too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store
1,new update has ruined the appthe reminder option is no longer available with ringtoneswhy the heck should i keep this app now in my phone deleting
1,does not refresh on samsung phones i have done every troubleshooting step and more to no avail
1,pop up stating  the app has been blocked by the system please authorize the app in your device settings troubleshooting or refresh background tasks  is flashing on my device may i know what is this about
1,cant even name my tasks
1,i dont know how i feel
1,i got just scam rs 200 for pro version nothing happened good times
1,doesnt save my timeline have to redo my while schedule now
1,the tutorial doesnt help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isnt easy to understand i have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out i wouldnt recommend this to anyone
1,i was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it
1,the app would be nice if it actually gave you a tutorial on how it should be used it seems almost like clickbait with one appealing look and then its not what you expected or needed yes its very organized and but nothing is explained
1,not very user friendly uninstalled immediately
1,pagué por la versión premium y ahora igualmente veo ads en la app la app no cuenta con respaldos automáticos ni un login al menos decente lástima que una app tan buena la estén dejando perder ante el montón de apps de productividad que hay en la store
1,worst app dont install
1,the one thing that made this app better than the others was that it was ad free uninstalling
1,to me its not user friendly i dont like the question up front before a tour of the app its very limited unless you pay for the pro version i think when picking a routine or something a bar or something should pop up with options or ideas to choose from
1,confusing and useless
1,not easy to usealways begging to buy pro version
1,this app has started to give me full screen pop up ads
1,i buy pro version but it features are not given to me
1,couldnt figure out
1,bekar app at all 
1,too difficult to figure out how to set up cant add times to daily routines this app is a waste of space
1,hello the app keeps disappearing from my notifications i already allowed notification access and persistent notification on my settings i also whitelisted the app on my battery saver but it still doesnt work help please 
1,it was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine
1,hard to use
1,not user friendly at all they definitely need to work on the user experience
1,oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time also it is not uninstalling
1,not really functional
1,bad the reminders not working many times trouble shooting
1,way to confusing to use the tutorial didnt help at all
1,cant even get past the first screen i get a notice that my phone is blocking the app but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel ive looked all over my settings theres nothing i can find to change to allow this app to do something frankly im dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has especially as it hasnt told me why
1,worst app ever because there is no reminder bell things i think there is but it doesnt work i cant even remember that i have this app with reminder thing will be better i spent two hours to write my routine plan and i thought there is reminder its not easy to use this app too i am deleting this useless app immediately alarm doesnt work at all how disappointing 
1,em app ra bai ardham ai sasthaledhu
1,sobad
1,worst app doesnt work
1,worst app waste of time
1,i really didnt understand the interface and its too complicated 
1,way to confusing to do something simple
1,looks great alarms dont work the notifications just dont work on my motorola g7 plus running android 9
1,the user interface makes no sense
1,not good worst app
1,app looks good but does not notify me on my oppo i foloowed the instructions to fix this however they are outdated so i cannot fix this problem
1,its an okay app
1,its too complex
1,cant do anything unless you buy the pro version
1,not work in my tab lenovo yoga 3 bed experience 
1,why you changed layout to old oneits really bad and annoying
1,sir i already did all step but i still face notification ringing problem
1,hard to understand setup could not schedule tasks to weekdays does not even show a calendar 
1,id like to give it a 5 star very much the app is very useful convenient and easy to use and whats even better is that it allows the user to modify the alarm sound icon etc as we please that makes it much easier to organize our schedule but the app no longer works after ive changed my phone i dont know if the issue is about my phone i used mi a1 before and oppo currently or the app ive read about the configuration to get the app back to work but to no avail please help ty
1,can i get a refund
1,bhai very very very very bad asp
1,removed support for google drive backups
1,i hated that you cannot edit certain things for example when you go to make a schedule theres no option to delete blank slots no obvious anyway
1,not very user friendly atleast for me the alarm doesnt ring it on only vibrates i have to put every thing manually like if its 11 am in the clock it gives me optionts what i m going to do from 12 pm and even after using it for a week i am not clear how dis format gonna helm me
1,wont synch to calendar have to buy pro version
1,bruh i literally have no clue how this app works
1,this app isnt optimized for use its just a concept for example the alarm plays music but cant be shut off theres no acknowledge alarm so if it starts paying music yeah it never stops this is only one of many bugs so bad it breaks the app dont waste your time
1,bogus app update isnt working i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current
1,hate itt
1,not working in my phone
1,very disappointed about the recent update i had everything work fine till the update scrambled everything
1,not what i wanted wanted a timeline
1,the idea is great and i would have loved this however i will not pay to be able to use different routines for different days this app is nothing more than a way for them to trap you into payment dont bother with this one
1,programmer does nog work properly it is changing times and dates on his own instead of saving time it is costing me time and money for the pro version i ran into this problem a few days after my purchase so im not able to get a refund while the app is unreliable so practically unusuable
1,cant buy pro version on note 9 apparently in app billing is not available on my device guess i cant give you my money
1,bought the pro version amount got deducted and programer version became accessible but after sometime its showing that i have to buy the pro version again kindly troubleshoot this problem
1,has something wrong it takes the routine i created for one day and do it for all days
1,there is no time tablethis app is fake
1,bad experience
1,how to use this help me please
1,i found it odd that the app didnt have preset hourly reminders most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours for example gyming twice or thrice a day the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you another example of this would be  reminder on every thursdays at 7am and 8pm i should be reminded of insert habit  instead its jungle of toggles that seem to not make sense
1,wow from 5 stars to one you guys ruined your perfect scheduling app why the new routines layout is inefficient and has several flaws cant use it at all if trying to plan my routine makes me want to throw my phone against a wall please bring back the old routines format asap
1,incoherent jumble
1,what is the use of this app if it can not show notification with sound also can not alert me when i m buzy in others chaos
1,interface is not really satisfactory
1,i have bad experience
1,please tell me how to use the app
1,some thing is comming in front if screen and interepting app is not runs in notification bar
1,hi have been looking for a app which remind me each and every hour because im a student and i need a that kind of app but in your application this feature is not available 
1,i missed my work today because of your stupid weak alarm method this means ive lost some money notification reliability should be of paramount importance if something doesnt work 100 remove it very disappointed very edit i didnt get any warning nothing if the other option is the recommended one which i hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar other apps work without doing this it doesnt mean the other one is not working bad im forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure which is very inconvenient
1,waste app
1,i did not understand
1,this app is to complicated
1,why this app requires so much of settings in one time 1like it should be in recent apps2 if internet is off it doesnt works3 even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings than to it crashes it requires an immediate update with all the bugs fixed soon or people wouldnt even write a review they would uninstall the app and find better alternatives
1,it will ruin your plan you are going to waste your time customizing it downloading this app will increase your screen time and degrade your efficiency
1,most of the things are paid
1,the new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect
1,i donk like this app anymore
1,ive bought the pro version and after a week it disappeared disappointing
1,the widget doesnt work it appears only few minutes and then it disappears so i need to add ot manually again
1,free options are hard to find and bundled with pro version cant open free without ad for pro version literally clicked one thing after opening your app for the first time and it instantly went to a pop up of the pro version im not going to navigate your app to find only the free options that are given to me bundled in with the pro versions when there are other apps that are available that never mention pro version which i downloaded
1,this app started out great everything was so organized and i was happy i had a digital schedule with reminders to carry with me but it stopped giving me notifications it also stopped showing my reminders all together i wanted to uninstall the app for a while because its never working but today was the last straw i had a reminder put for my midterm but of course since its such an awful app it didnt notify me i missed my midterm screw this app dont download it
1,impossible to use
1,not worth it dont buy
1,totally joke
1,i have not installed itnot sure if it was somehow installed by hacking
1,lose my time 
1,how to restore my pro version
1,i hate it its confusing
1,play tune does not work on gionee
1,the most trash app i have ever seen
1,its most timewasting app instead i downloaded this for schedule n it asks to buy a pro version for it it should be mentioned first before we dwnld this app
1,dont know how to use it because many icon were showing to upgrade to new version popups
1,its notification tune is frequency low
1,stupid
1,changes the time of routine when adding new ones completely useless
1,u should give a shor git tutorial that how to use it u should also add some random time tables also its not a good app
1,sab kuch khud se hi karna pad raha h
2,well the app interface itself is quite confusing the interface should be more simple  easy to understand
2,pretty good notifications dont work however
2,in redmi phone app not working please solve this issue
2,redesigned dialogs are broken 1 import day from dialog on routine edit screen  no monday  tuesday in the day list spinner 2  notification dialog on routine edit screen  no play voice checkbox please tell me if theres a better way to report bugs like this
2,why is break tag forcefully added in all activities why cant i remove it why deleting tags delete the whole activity edit  i dont think you quite understood the problem i cannot change or remove the break tag even in work activities it forces the break tag and i cannot replace it plus if an activity has 3 tags and one of them gets removed doesnt mean youll remove the whole activity
2,felt complicated app to set up
2,this app is really good for people especially students who are busy with their schedules however since the last update in feb 2020 i cant make new schedule the ok or done button was gone
2,the app is always blocked by the system even i allow all the permission of this app i cant hear or see any notifications even i fixed all the settings both of the app and my phone
2,i am too much confuse to use this app kindly help me please
2,latest update sucks
2,great app but the notification ringtone doesnt work which is really important for me hope you add a calendar feature for the week at least
2,crashes at start
2,i installed and then uninstalled it unless i am mistaken there is no way to edit daybyday deviations from a routine so i can set up a routine but then have no way to track how well i followed it day by day for instance exercised for half an hour instead of an hour or started late or missed it completely or did things out of order am i missing something
2,not so usefull
2,very good app but it would be perfect if the app actually didnt shut down and not give me notifications please fix this
2,not working notification
2,doesnt able to back up on google drive
2,its hard to understand how it works
2,it was okay could be better
2,its kinda bad sorry
2,you must plan in resuming the reminder tab its really important by the way im a paid user
2,this app is being killed in the background whatever i do i have given all the permissions but still it is being killed my phone is oppo a5 please do something devs
2,what i didnt know i was looking for hate planning my day on the calendar and tried to use 90 different todo lists to schedule my day update  their new change combining calendar events with reminders doesnt work for me i only use this for talking reminders no scheduling
2,i came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because i really wanted it to work each time i tried i spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it incredibly unintuitive no in app explanation and the online getting started page doesnt explain much on what each features do edit thank you developer for the reply it shows that you care i wish you all the best in making the improvements the idea behind the app is honestly good
2,my phone keeps blocking the apps action no matter what i do it keep showing it was blocked troubleshoot and refresh background task
2,i like the way its present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring in the system i allowed everything i needed too but still its not working out
2,useless without pro
2,reminders should not be transfered in event section it was better before to figure out events and remiders separatly
2,how to use this app  very bad experience please simplify the process nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day
2,i would love this app only if the notifications work at all there were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my oppo f5 i tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times yet nothing worked would give 5 if i do not have this issue
2,fair enough for ads but now the widget isnt showing anything anymore its just blank ive set up all events and schedule and its still blank
2,ive only just started using it and can already tell it has potential it has a simple ui but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work i purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work but i cant find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles if its even possible starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends
2,im sure the app is nice but i cannot add a routine or any activity nor i can delete anything
2,its just okay
2,would agree that it isnt very user friendly functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time
2,please update the app i want to use the app but after a day alarm is not ringing  i think this app have too much bugs and problems
2,this tune can make alarm i set a few alarm is not ringing
2,this app is really very good but notifications arent working i tried everything it told me to do but its still not working
2,im still getting accustomed i like the simplicity
2,limited unless you buy the full version i spent time looking around trying to work with the app a lot of things i tried wanted me to upgrade which is why i found another i feel my review is fair sorry
2,useless and time consuming got pro version but no option for refund
2,has potential but made no sense i didnt know what the hell i was doing needs more explanation and help
2,app cannot keep track of an atypical everytime i set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work im deleting this app for sure
2,too confusing
2,great at first but now its getting on my nerves i tried to create a routine for each day of the week today is monday and for some reason my monday routine shows up for tomorrow wednesday thursday and friday ive had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well there seems to be a setting where i can change this but that doesnt seem to do the trick it shouldnt be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week uninstalled
2,so its good i payed for pro but the issue im having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever i try and add it it takes me to edit my routine its really annoying because id like my routine in one clean place if this is fixed id definitely rate it 4 stars
2,i was trying out the routine trick i set the times and dates but it just wouldnt work please help
2,app is good but the programmer feature is bad i have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days so if i have late meetings on wed and fri i want to enable a separate set of routines for these days similarly for weekends the programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that i bought the pro version for i want small reusable routines that i can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates
2,i didnt know how to do anything
2,how to do so the link is not opening only
2,nothing special just a calendar app not worth the time it takes to set up clunky at best poor layout minimal instructions not intuitive to use
2,not very easy to use you can figure it out after you play with it long enough but over all not very intuitive
2,im so confused and frustrated trying to figure this app out
2,i got no notification
2,annoying to set up youd think it would be easy to have the exact same same schedule just 30 min later
2,edit been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what i need to reach within the app i only use the routines no events or reminders i have a separate app for that google assistant wit a calendar to add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it i end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper deleting amending the times and adding them manually with the new times thats counterproductive i need an easy way to move
2,osm app but now its update an i am not able to see my all reminders that i use to remind my self before uninstalling the app
2,beneficial to get my goal its heplful to make discipline and commitments to yourselfits continually popping up notification that what you have decided according to your time table over all its good and helpful for students
2,very bad app i organised all of my activities took me 1 hour to complete my planner then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am so all my afternoon activities where at the morning for example if i had to eat at 1pm it said that i had to eat at 1am so i changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule wasting 1 hour
2,calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature
2,useless i dont want to purchase the app as this free version offers no good features the paid app might be betterrating 2 just because of the feedback on user review
2,the minimum timer is 5 mins so useless for me i had hoped to use this as an exercise timer i need alternating time countdowns running consecutively eg 3m30s 3m1m 5m1m plus a reminder for when my favorite combat sports are on tv ill keep looking
2,okayish
2,you basically cant do anything if you dont buy the full version
2,the free version is pretty minimal
2,statistical data for daily routine and check marks for completed or missed routines are expected
2,good not bad
2,edit even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great thank you for taking my review into consideration please please please bring back the old horizontal interface or at least have an option for it i used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday but now i find it quite useless i understand how it could work for some people but its definitely not working for everyone as ive seen in other reviews
2,cant move the tasks up or down
2,if u want to study you need to plan dont use apps
2,there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface new is ugly
2,clunky complicated and confusing not streamlined ugly color choice for non pro just a disappointment
2,how to use bakwas i am vrry an gry
2,i would give this app 5 stars but if you press silence notifications you can never turn them back on
2,ive spent hours on it already and im just not getting it looks like most tutorials are for an older version cant figure out how to create shorter than 7 day routines whats the difference between a routine and an event etc
2,i had added a routine  by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from todays date i m unable to change the date its frustrating
2,really weird formatting im trying to be more organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app
2,wasnt sure to begin with as its not all that user friendly but how frustrating to take a chance anyway  pay for premium only to have it not sync with my calendars wasnt really any other reason to pay for premium except that what a small waste of money its of no use to me now 
2,dont like the new changes
2,everything i wanted it for i had to do the pro mode
2,android keep blocking the app from sending notifications ive redownloaded it and put an exception for it in the battery settings to work without interruption but nothing happens  fix it
2,the new interface is cluttered and hard to use edited in response to the query below  in the older interface a routine had a separate page for each day of the week now its a continuous scroll the older approach seems cleaner
2,ive been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the add notification options and there doesnt seem to be any way for example i need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes but theres no option for that we need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want instead of only having presets  edit now after using it for a while the app has been plagued with reliability issues it often is late with the notification by a few minutes or the service completely stops and id have to restart the service due to this issue i cannot rely on this app for anything that is timesensitive because id end up being late for all my appointments and jobs ive contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they havent been able to fix the issue
2,the most recent update just made it harder to move times around
2,it is better if dont have buy pro version hoping an app free offline soon 
2,i was recommended this app by a friend who loves it i got the premium version as i expected it to have better features this app is very confusing to use i even went to the help section and was even more confused im very disappointed
2,it is a good idea but its not really easy to use in fact its quite complicated  i bought premium because they advertised i could set schedules per day and i can but not how i had hoped i recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor and additionally make any small changes in each individual day
2,routines dont last forever any more
2,genuinely not a good app
2,"while it certainly wasnt expensive it was a waste of money in the fact 
that i found this app to do very little more than any calendar after 
reading the faq it says its more than a calendar how especially since 
adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event the 
routine function is a missed opportunity in that i think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality its about creating 
calendar events that repeat a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there when i think of tuning my time spent im thinking 
better organization for smaller tasks then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that i was never actually notified about 
lol what irony unfortunately it was not time or money well spent"
2,"u should work on the phones like oppo and others so that customer dont 
find problem"
2,"play voice option does not work consistently it regularly does not sound 
the vocal reminder this is a function i rely on how do i contact you to 
discuss further"
2,"pro version doesnt work correctly i have more than one google account 
app keeps ignoring account used for purchase and using other account i 
have to delete gmail accounts for the app to recognize the account used for 
purchase and if i try to add the deleted accounts back the app starts to 
ignore the account used for purchase"
2,not so easy perhaps pro version may b good uninstall
2,"i really liked the app helped me a lot with managing my time efficiently 
to get the most out of my day but since i updated it it started acting up 
it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now its 
setting its own times or plainly refusing to be moved to a later time 
block which is infuriating and the app also slowed down considerably 
after the update"
2,"a core function missing is the ability to disable a routine daily 
occurrence for a specific day for example i usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day so i created an event that happens every monday to friday 
today is a thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence i cant exercise 
today i wanted to change that my 68pm block of time just today but can 
only do so by deleting the event for every monday to thursday to clear my 
timeline makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to recreate 
that exercise block for all the other monday to fridays if something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next friday ill have to delete it alll and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline if you get this 
core feature right then the app would be complete"
2,its too confusing
2,not sure
2,lots of inapp purchases  not worth the time 
2,alarm not working  so no time strict
2,it is not what i want
2,its confusing
2,tried to plan my weekly schedule with the routines function but it kept randomly changing the times of the events as i made other edits for example an event i set for 4pm changed to 11am when i hit the button add break before event also annoying that you cant preview the notification sounds and have to add silly tags to each event such as housework
2,you have to buy pro version
2,купил версию pro сменился телефон что покупать снова тогда зачем такое приложение
2,the new widget is not looking good please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version
2,so far i like it i thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline the time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential
2,this app is a good idea and i like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet i could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning  this app was no help to me all i recommend is that the app has to be a bit more selfexplanatory i did not know how to do anything
2,i regret buying this app tldr dont use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time so unnecessary and impossible to revert if you accidentally click pm instead of am once your whole day is deleted permanently also every time i want to sync between my phone and my tablet i have to export it to google drive and then import it from the other device also you cant copy items or days to another time please make this app more user friendly
2,everything is under pro version
2,reminder didnt work on vivo
2,tried it out the time function which is 90 of the app imho is clunky the default end time is until next activity but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you cant change it back then if you add a task that overlaps other start times it deletes the other activities i spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that i had erased my entire afternoon schedule because i made a mistake when changing the end time of something midday this app was for me ironically a waste of time
2,i dont get a single notification the calendar doesnt work well
2,at first this app worked well then the next day this app stopped notifying my next activities it stucked on the last activity before the next day
2,stopped working after a week
2,after recent update notifications messed up sometimes i cant turn it off so it rings until you reset the device
2,idk how it works
2,timer dont follow exact minutes in case of 5min reminder it takes about 67 minutes to notify painful
2,in timeline section i cannot see the upcominh events i can only see the events for today and next day and that kills the purpose of the time table apps people need to see the upcoming event in order to schedule nrw events so they wont overlap with each other keep up the good work and this will be a good app
2,confusing to use eventhough me being an it professional for 12 years always forces you to buy pro version better apps are out there for weekly planning
2,have to refresh timeline manually
2,nothing special
2,i am a student i want custom remainder so i am unable to use the app rest all great
2,time changing on widget is not responsive enough need bout 1 mins
2,i want to create a regular schedule and be able to amend times for regular activities on the occasional week  unfortunately when you amend the time once it changes your schedule completely  edit  i appreciate the response and looked at the guide   i dont want to have to create a whole new bespoke routine day if i am just amending the timing of one event  unfortunately this is not flexible enough as this wont save me any time
2,i like the app but you cant tick things off i like to go through my tasks and tick each one off as i do it then i feel i am accomplishing something  i feel i am  getting somewhere if it had that it would be brilliant
2,essential app i have ever installed but i couldnt set customised ringtone for notifications why
2,i work in a school and the schedule has times like 442 which this app doesnt do like it but absolutely useless to me
2,the application cleaned up all information i was adding for few days really disappointed that i wasted my time it the application is not  tested properly if it has such a major bugs
2,you have to pay for some advanced thing you have a limited space to type stuff in for reminders just not for me
2,this app isnt very good its laggy and you need pro to do any important stuff
2,calender sync should be free
2,not intuitive for my use seems like you have to create routines rather than just simply track activities
2,this app is ok but i dont understand why i cannot see the whole month or a graph showing what amount off time i spent doing individual activities   i spent a little while tagging and creating different routines you wont be able to merge multiple routines it will delete the first thing you merged or any activity you added  if this doesnt improve you might as well use google apps instead there is nothing too special about this app i regret paying for it
2,very confusing i couldnt even set a daily reminder  edit to have a daily reminder i need to create a routine set number of days whatever that means to 1 open it add an activity create a new tag for it cause i cant just give it a simple name then go back and enable the routine thats extremely confusing as for a simple thing like this dont want to do this again
2,didnt notify me when i had to do things
2,nice but crashing
2,confusing i feel i cant really plan my tasks and things for the day i dont like how i cant name an activity and only have vague tags to me this app is more like a record rather than an actual planner use it to see where your time goes but if you wanted to actually plan your day it is not good for that  update thanks for the response i look forward to seeing future updates
2,very complicated for normal use
2,the app worked perfectly for first reminder and then no alarm ringing thereafter lenovo a2020a
2,hello sir i am using ur app app design is goot no dought but i am facing an issue when i set an reminder i wont pop up on tim just dont do anything remains same but routine remind me on time please tell me the solution so that i can use reminder as well
2,notificationsalarms dont make any noise or appear on the phone no matter how i modify the settings
2,i loved this app until my phone crashed and i had to restore my data from the google drive backup i had set my daily backup for both local and google drive but the backup wasnt up to date and i have lost all the changes i made on my phone before it crashed really disappointed
2,i have been searching for months for a schedule  planner that uses a continuous alarm until i switch it off myself yours is actually great and i would rate it at least a 4 if the alarm worked properly the old nokia i used some time ago had a builtin app that did the job properly
2,the notifications dont work so doesnt actually help with my time keeping skills actually missed a few things i needed to do today as i was relying on the notifications to remind  me
2,tried to set up routines but editing tasks is too finicky tasks i just entered disappeared for some reason
2,whenever i open the app it is not reflected current routine everytime i need to refresh it
2,no test period of all options
2,this scheduler is severely lacking basic and simple features  the reminder function needs to give the user the option to select specific and multiple days of the week and dates he or she wants the reminder to repeat itself daily weekly monthly and yearly arent good enough i want certain reminders to only be for weekdays weekends and eg mondays and saturdays  the reminder function needs to be able to repeat itself multiple times in a day when certain events are coming up i want to be reminded 24 hours 1 hour and 5 minutes before to the event  the reminder function also needs an option to decide the duration of the sound and vibration im sometimes not close to to my phone and might miss the reminder when it only rings for a few seconds or even a few minutes and make it so that you can also set the time with the keypad not only by turning the clock arms around
2,cant do anything unless i pay not worth paying for
2,i dont know if the pro app has a one off timer but that is the problem i have at the moment else this would be the only one i use there is another very simple interval timer that i like but having them separately is nice unless i can set something like that up to trigger within my schedule this is one of my favorite apps but i two started so this might be seen i am having a little trouble buying the pro version since another account has my trusted funds
2,i do not get alaram please help me
2,you cant see your whole week schedule on just one page so if you wanted to schedule something with someone you have to flip through each single day also when you create specific events they arent incorporated into your routine for a single periodcycle they are two separate things so you may get a notification about it beforehand but when you look through your weeks schedule it doesnt show up there its great for routines but doesnt incorpotate events into your week which is hard for scheduling
2,alarm and notification did not work
2,when i wanna change the ringtone for remembering  it changes it back to its default  it would be good if it dint 
2,useless it does not sound an alarm it just vibrate 3 times  it wont notify me   please make it sound an alarm
2,good idea but needs work i dont like the fact that it will not let you create to routine events at the same time for example if i add a routine event named alone time and i said it from 3 pm to 5 pm and then i create another routine event from 3 pm to 315 and i named it having a meal it will override it will not create it  that needs to be fixed
2,i have set a sound with the notifications but it does not work
2,you could just use your phones calendar
2,not giving notification or no pop up comes
2,its a very useful app
2,my notification doesnt work
2,i didnt wanted this type of app
2,only an orange spreadsheet that makes this calculation time_lengthnumber_of_days it doesnt really track your de facto time spending it doesnt help anything for schedulling study for example
2,it works fine and has no other issues but the notification doesnt worki have tried several times and it doesnt notify me when the tag switchesi checked my notification settings toosometimes i get the notification and sometimes notso probably there is nothing to do with the device settings
2,so we can try it before we buy it in the first version
2,do not get notification sound
2,notification sound not working it didnt alarm
2,helps a lot to manage my hectic schedule try it
2,cant use application because the advertisements cover the buttons
2,the alert doesnt work
2,its nice and easy to usebut it always stop at one time and not continuing the scheduleand no notifications eventhough i set for notifications the worse part is that the schedule is not continuing and i have to log in into the apps to continue the schedulewhats going onpls fix itthx
2,great time organizer but  there should be an option to check off completed tasks  and there has to be more pro benefits  just bought the pro version and then realised that with all the new updates you liberate the pro option to all users  i wouldnt have paid that much money if i knew it was only for removing ads
2,when i first installed the app it worked well however recently i started getting notifications at incorrect times out by several hours i have not changed anything since i set it up a few months ago this app is pretty much useless now
2,widget doesnt show your routines
2,its all just boring
2,whats up this app i open another app and deletes what info i put in i cant go back and forth with it  disqualified 
2,the app itself is fantastic the fact it doesnt seem to sync with anything  i dont understand am i missing something
2,unintuitive and restrictive
2,the options you have are stupid when i tried to set up notifications the save function does not work
2,why constant ads for such a simple app
2,like your logo you should improve your apps ui so it becomes more attractive nice app improve ui and ill download it again and give 5 stars 
2,why my phone cant download this app
2,needs fixing
2,having trouble w the widget only shows one thing the 900am task i dont get it  cant add any more
3,its a great app  but i do have a very useful suggestion could u also add like a streak maintainer in the routines  like if i create and enable a weekly routine so everytime i follow the routine honestly i will have a one day streak and so on it will be quite movtivational for everyone
3,hey there lots of compulsory improvements needed asap like check boxes short note or comment on routine and many more suppose my class which was on routine got cancelled and i want to delete it from my schedule i cant do it it still get counted in my day summary you got potential dont just give a way to other apps cheers
3,its a really great app and i love it but for some reason since last week its not opening and working well it shows troubleshooting problems but when i check nothing is there also i have given all permissions but still i have to refresh every 34 hours to get notifications please check it otherwise its great
3,pro simple  use routines to schedule your week and it will repeat set it and forget it will remind you con barebones  thats all it does using programing or blocks is more time consuming than its worth feedback  make blocks a drag and drop icon that can be programmed into your regular schedule at a whim eliminate the need to specify a time and date instead give the option for a duration eg workout 1 hour
3,its fairly good im mainly posting this review to suggest that timetune pro be a monthly subscription of a dollar some people might not go for that but in reality it would help the developers to be better funded so they could make the app the best of its kind is timetune the best no its potential is incredible though and i really like the approach and design
3,good app very nice but is confusing i do not understand anything but no problem i will learn then this is a good app
3,the ui looks good but can be confusing the different labels programmer etc dont make much sense in the context of the app you cant check an item as done and if something in your day changes and you need to adjust or reorder your routine for one day you cant which makes the app a bit useless
3,ads are ok but not sliding or moving ones  they are distracting me right off the bat while i am just starting to check the app out  gotta move on
3,even though the app size is small it serves it purpose well other than apps made for routine managementui can be improved also the pro version button in the bottom is kinda annoyingbut overall its a really well made app
3,the problem is the phone is not ringing even though ring is turned on output is given alarm volume yet its not ringing
3,this app is nice but i put notifications and it dont give me notifications so my dismissed so please improve this problem
3,while i like the app before i dont like the tags thing i wish that was just something you could shut off i dont like that i have to set up a tag just to put something in the schedule
3,its okay
3,better app but app do not play sound but give a single notification no alarmsong which i chose to play do not worked can you help me with that please 
3,its really nice although i would like to see an option for subtaskspls update
3,i really wish it was possible to see an entire month or maybe just a week at a time instead of only 1 day at a time you could click on a date to go back to only seeking 1 date at a time but it should be possible to have an overview of your week its honestly huge problem and it could boost my rating from 3 to 5 stars if they make this an option
3,i have not used it right now i will download it and sharing my experience if this has changed my life or not
3,really disappointed with new update the widget look really bad after the update please change it the annoying thing is the length of the colour tab in the widget alter according to the writing in the tab there is no uniformity its look weird now 
3,used to like this app even if wasnt the smoothest some remarks about the new update 1 removed colors i had a colorcoding scheme and now its all gone will they do the same in a few months when i have a tag system 2 ui is sleeker but still has amateurish mistakes eg tags are more prominent than task name in schedule view 3 adding an event when im in schedule takes me to eventsblocks page which means i have to tap schedule and scroll back to where i was when adding multiple
3,am a timetune paid user  been using for more than a month this looks like another user interface for just reminders nothing more than this  an average application
3,its a good app for scheduling your day although its not great and have room for improvement i do not know exactly what as i am not an expert but it feels that way one thing that it should incorporate right away is the possibility of archiving routines and tags not only keep or delete i will rate 4 stars if they add this feature and 5 stars if they manage to make it a great app for time scheduling
3,theres nothing special about this application it works as any builtin calendar application you can make schedule manually or you can add entries manually
3,it is a good app i must say but it doesnt work properly for this reason i had uninstalled it
3,didnt make any sense to me i started using this app and attempted to make a sceduale but couldnt figure it out
3,i dont know how to use it  help me please 
3,it works best till 5 to 6 hours but after a time that didnt stop ringing it is showing that your sittings block the time toon application it rings and rings till i uninstall this application
3,its okbut not free really costs 5 bucks to get basoc fratures onannouying ads off i dont feel like investing in something that in the end may or may not work out while there are many systems that could easily replace this app the routines can be easily called recurring tasks and that feature is offered by almost every respectable calendar app free 60 trial period would encourage me but sneaking in payment under the label of free app is what annoys me on principle dont do it
3,wonderful but please give total version in less amount of price
3,awesome i upgraded to support 2 requests to get 5stars 1 i need a move back optionif my 12 oclock runs late i need to push all the other tasks that day back by x minutes 2 option to automatic cloud backup or sync data from timetune to calendar
3,i love the layout and different features two things that i would love changed or added are 1 the ability to either edit a routine for a singular day or to clear a routine from a singular day like when i have an atypical day and cant follow my regular routine and 2 the ability to see the overlap in eventsroutines if two different things occur at the same time
3,nice looking app with good user interface the ability to check off daily tasks add goals with subtasks  note taking capability would be perfect
3,used to work really well now the notifications wont work on my xiaomi phone rendering ot pretty much uselessand i tried everything
3,seems ok atm but i cant tune the alarm off when a task pops up
3,i like it just try it
3,its kinda cool but the alarm icon disappear immediately the app is closed and therefore do not show notification when the time set is due
3,i like the concept but the app itself is confusing to navigate and set up and is not very userfriendly
3,really great app  giving three star only because having problem to make routines after adding five or six activities it stops working cant add anymore  please notify me after fixing the issue
3,its voice is very slow it must be louad  please fixed it
3,the sound of reminder is very low
3,love the routine schedule i help you to create im horrible at establishing routines  sticking to them so i need help like this
3,this is a good app it has background issues i have refresh to make it notifications work
3,i dont like that it forgets the settings like repeat daily no notification etc so you have to change it every time also no way to stop the vibration when selecting certain things also when you add a new event the date gets to the next day and after it says that you can only input less than 24 hours bottom line good idea finicky to use
3,please improve the persistent notification when i close the app it get removed it should be there for all time
3,great idea such a usefully app we did have the ability to sync with our calendar the widgets were super cute and looked amazing on my phone however the alarm system isnt the best i would have troubles switching it off because it wasnt in the notification bar and there was no popup for me to turn it off if have to switch off my phone which was really irritating thank you
3,works okay if youre looking for routine alarm but not exactly as a motivation and control of routines
3,the alarms set are not going off when theyre supposed to
3,i liked this app in its previous form but they have been reducing options one of my favorite thing was the repeat by minutes option its gone
3,i have tried various time organizing apps and this one is best till now
3,a really good app but since the new update the interface look so bad was so much cuter and clean before now its weird
3,im still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot one would not waste time if they have this app in hand
3,this is a decent time managment app the ability to create routines is handy though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping the most recent update as of 3302020 made the app look much cleaner which is nice i would like to see more personalization options twards the look af the tags and app choices now are very slim the 5 price tag for the pro version doesnt feel worth it yes buyers remorse so if you can manage fine with the free version stick with that
3,i am so confused
3,notification sound does not work now before it does
3,the app was awesome but it stopped working in a week im not able to add any routine now
3,its usefull  but would be much nicer if there was an option to play a notification tone just once instead of repeating it continuously
3,hi thanks for responding and ill be more specific please bring back the pretty orange background for the top bar and each of the routines the current color is too pale
3,when i tried to load in my own alarm sound it wouldnt let me
3,i was using journal but cant write much until my hand gets better so i was looking for the app to plan my day preciously by time thought time line of this app would work like all the icon and premade taps but disappointed that i can not use those icons by itself for my event unless you creat another routine if devs can modify the app that makes all those taps can be added to timeline by itself with my own time not only as events or routine that would be perfect thanks
3,i really like this app but i stopped using it because its too hard to type out my entire routine on the app i wish it was windows compatible
3,pretty good could be better
3,this is a very cool app and thus have the ratings how ever it will be nice if you can add the functionality of sharing task or even with other users this will make it the all in one projecttask manager review update  previously i was able to pick custom tags when setting a new event but now i cant and i have to pick a color and look for the same icon each time i want to create a new event this is counter productive as the main aim of the app is to help optimize time please fix this
3,tried this app for a bit the logic is very different from what i need so the experience wasnt good this app focuses on routines and is built around this concept it was very confusing at first because it started with abstract ideas not what average joe is already familiar with eg calendartimeline and the entire experience just felt awkward for me all i want is see the dayweekmonth add todo items one by one and be able to turn any of these items into routines when i want to
3,difficult to use and doesnt show name of activity only when i click on it
3,i like the ideas of the app however the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines there doesnt seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well it is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day i would like to see an option to edit or rearrage single intances of items in the time line without effecting the base routine or future dates
3,stupid decision to remove timer
3,its ok but i wish i could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one eg if i have yoga 910 then study 1012 and want to swap them i cant just move around the blocks i have to delete study change the time of yoga then add study with the new time its time consuming and not practical would also be good to be able to change settings of a routine eg from 4 days to 2 instead of deleting the entire routine and start over
3,i sadly had to uninstall this app as tgere was no general optout option for direct marketing activity i could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners which for an app like this is just too invasive very saddened as the app does look really good
3,i used to use this app to set intervals of when i would check in to games i was playing but since they removed the timer feature for some reason the scheduling stuff doesnt suit my purposes still the app should be able to help you maintain a schedule just fine but most phones have that feature built in
3,really like this app but wish i could see my whole calendar or at least have the option to search for a specific date that would make it perfect as i want to use it as my go to planner
3,manca solo una visualizzazione in prospettiva degli eventi che faccia capire bene quanto tempo occupano
3,love the app bt still some feature like temporary modification if somebody is late then adjustment is required and please add tasker integration for advance options if you can people will ready to pay for tasker plugin support also
3,my original review seems to have disappeared i have an issue on my galaxy note s8 where i cant turn off the alarms without uninstalling i received a response from support but couldnt respond directly their response was simply that i should be able to swipe the notification and the sound go away yes i agree that should happen however that isnt what happens there is no notification from the app for the alarm i receive other notifications from the app running out of room to explain
3,routine module and programming is nice any plans to make it a tracker app  log if the schedule event is accomplished completely partially or not accomplished for example  drinking water few times a day exercising 1hr per day
3,i love the app great concept but the thing is you cant use it or it wont notify you not unless you open the app once you close the background it will lost
3,theres a lot to be improved hope this app to get better with the time
3,good but very confusing it was good if i knew how to use it the whole set up was very confusing and hard to understand i really hope in the future it becomes simpler
3,great ui the idea is great but need a way to mark tasksroutine item as complete and so we cant even know our progress guess the use case itself is completely different
3,i think the app should request permission over other apps or if possible have it as a widget it keeps getting inactive when removed from recent files tab of the phone
3,it doesnt ring or do any sign to remind me about my work
3,when you start to reschedule things the interface is very awkward moving times around for example moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive
3,its really confusing its hadd to make routines and stuff just over all really confusing but over great way to track routines i love the tag idea mabey you should add a default school tag
3,not enough customatization
3,its serves a purpose
3,i think the app is satisfaying my will but the pro version keeps a nonecard user not happy so im giving you 35 bcuz of this
3,has potential but the interface isnt user friendly at all
3,this is app is perfect just need a checklist and daily weekly and monthly tracker for each task had it been have all these i would have given all 5 stars you know sometimes we missor intentionally ignore reminders and we need trackers for those for self development
3,hmm i just dont like it
3,critical
3,how different it is from google calendar  your idea is good and interesting i am a knd of person who try following this
3,notification does not sound pls develop why can not be set for 6 days in a routine week  please like this
3,its really only useful if you are doing recurring tasks at the same time on the same days etc i set up a lot of tags categories but they can only be applied to the routines not events or reminders i was also not able to copyduplicate events which would have allowed me to reuse the same tasks at different times or days without setting up a brand new event disappointed in the apps scheduling capabilities
3,this app is great if you know how to use it i downloaded it and it just doesnt work for me it says its a routine app but it doesnt really let you put your whole routine it only lets you put one reminder at a time
3,good great greatest very good nice decent adjusting
3,it does the job i wanted that is to ring alarm at the set time however i am unable to clear the timeline that is old ones couldnt get much help from their help center
3,it does not remind us so i deleted this app
3,not really the app that i was looking for but ok
3,not bad but not great pros 3rd party calendar sync time line view icons  colour options to customise cons cant sync devices no task list or tick box more options needed such as daily time line view font size  highlight current day editing isnt easy  i think the whole app including widget could have a neater tidier look overall its not very intuitive needs more options  flexibity it has some way to go ive got premium btw
3,while it has helped me be more productive recently the notification settings are bugging out when i tap on add notification and select a louder notification for when i wake up and press done i find out sooner or later than it had reset it to the opener my default notification sound that is quiter this has caused me great annoyance because of this and do not know why this app decided to bug out
3,it would be better if there is an option in which we are able to check whether we really followed time table or not 
3,for 261 timetune background task error keep persists due to screen is off battery saver powered off you can also add new features refresh background tasks when accessing app toggle switch it refreshes everytime when they accessing the app even background tasks blocked by system
3,nice app but after enabling it whenever i tried to open clock from taskbar this aap gets open instead which i dont what
3,one problem with this app is it stops and also notification also hide and ask for refresh and troubleshooting then it again start show every time i have to open the app and refresh then it start working this must be solve
3,i wouldve given it full cuz its an amazing app and i would recommend it but the down is that it takes too long to set a schedule otherwise it is an awesome app
3,gets me moving when i get a reminder
3,this app has a lot of potential but a few things could be added and tweaked i recommend adding a calender and more icon options
3,im so confused with this app
3,first i was using this app but when i downloaded it after a long time then strange problems occured such as the routines remainder are not coming although its option is on also when i login back then a caption stating no authorisation provided to app is flashed please tell me how to resolve it
3,some features are to be paid
3,no reminder tone else 5 star
3,this app is useful but it would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday weekend day week2week4weekmonthetc it is badly in need of this feature i thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasnt helped at all and im disappointed i spent the money please say that it is an upcoming feature resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient
3,great concept
3,ui can be improved more rounded corners instead of hard corners it makes the app look more modern my opinion
3,bit complicated in adding routines i didnt understood
3,the layout for the app is awesome but it would be better if nonroutine task can be added into the timeline with the same activity for routine task
3,the app is good but it would be better if it had a timeline please do something about that
3,app is good but i want to suggest something  there should be to do list type of feature that is what sort of things we are doing regularly from our routine will be selected and those which left undone will be not selected in this way more clear picture of time allotment and productivity can be seen
3,this is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff i would suggest add some tutorial on youtube so anyone can get used to it and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version
3,just tested the pro version needs to be more stable sometimes my work starts at 12 am and it doesnt sync with my google calendar widget needs to be fine tuned not quite satisfied so 3 stars
3,i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me
3,not practical
3,the app is overall good just bought the upgraded version since i wanted to sync the google calender i still cannot sync the google calender into the calender and also would like to know if sync the routine from timetune into the google calender is possible thanks
3,its a good way to manage your time but after a while the timeline menu bugs out and stops sending notifications besides that the app is very good
3,its good i like the little picture icons i wish for 2 things that you can share as a jpg file and not a txt file to email and that the length of the boxes represented the amount of time used for example snack time would be a short box sleep would be a long box thanks
3,i love this app i would really love an option to check off or mark that a task was complete
3,hi please provide accepted pending decline tags on rutine notifications of activites and also show day progress for these tags or activites in app i think it will force the mind to follow daily schedule
3,i bought the pro version in hope i can organize my time to do my tasks but the progrmer just disables the routine thats all really the other thing i didnt like was to set a routine for a reoccurring like school or sleep i had to set it for every single day one by one you could have add a reapet feature to it im not happy i wish i could get my money back
3,not too bad
3,great potential but i cant use the app to its full extent due to its counterintuitive layout just filling two days in routine view turned it into an endless scroll shame the app really looked like what i was looking for reply thanks for taking my review into account yes i think a horisontal orientation would be much better maybe leave both options that way everyone can decide what best suits them
3,really dont like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it i find it to be extremely unnecessary but the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1 5 or 15 minute chunks is great and the programmer feature works well as always particularly good for planning out studies and work
3,it is useful but not the perfect
3,the concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand it would be eaier if there was a calendar setting andor addition to help the user plan along with a timeline
3,this is good but you need to update where we can sync on our desktop or another phone via google or else
3,i like this app but in the world of timeschedule management you have to be multiplatform i would recommend that your next step in development is a web interface as the majority of a professionals day is spent on a pc or laptop
3,im sure the pro version is great but it didnt keep my interest long enough
3,i used to love this app but now it has been ruined made things more complicated and v cant assign according to days of week
3,it does not play ring tone on my mobile
3,its not clear how much it cost the premium account also every time i try to go premium i get a message saying the inapp billing are not available on this device ive always do inapp purchasing and it was the first time that i got this issue really disappointed
3,how to view statistics
3,its simple and easy to use but notification often doesnt work about 10 times a day
3,no japanese support 
4,sometimes it stops working so you have to refresh the background tasks but its a nice app
4,if your phone isnt giving you notifications go to settings notifications output channel and change it to alarm it will make a sound timetune it would be smart to make this the default setting vibration still not working on samsung s10
4,good app but lacked cloud synchronization with more than one device
4,please add the number of days left for events which will be more helpful
4,great app one star cut for not being available at ios because i also have ipad and i want it to be on that too
4,hi timetune i love your app since then i just have a problem i dont know how to fix the blockage of timetune app on my infinix hot 9 your site for troubleshooting is not accessible for me overall this app is fine and satisfying edit troubleshooting doesnt work on infinix hot 9 hoping for its inclusion on troubleshooting sites edit i cant find any forums i am hoping for more improvements in the future ill be reinstalling the app after the update
4,its great but i would like to have an easier way of delaying my daily routine sometimes i wake up 1hr late so i have to go over the tasks one by one to delay each one 1hr for example if i could delay the hole routine at once would be much better the same if i want to start the routine 1hr before than planned also adding a pomodoro timer for some tasks would make this app perfect
4,why i cant set the clock in new activity there is no ok button and everytime im back the clock back to 12 am well ok button is invisible in my device
4,best productivity app ever would really be useful to have a widget to display our weekly routines in a grid box really rooting for this please developer make this feature
4,really enjoyed this app but was disappointed to find it doesnt automatically sync your schedule to your account i had to reset my phone and was bummed to see the schedule routines and tags i worked on for days tweaking it to fit my kids days perfectly was gone not sure i will take the time to redo it and will probably not use the app anymore although i really did like it if you do use it just make sure you back up your schedule
4,loves the app super simple and easy to use 
4,i like this app but its some function like reminding and posting are giggling i can understand that its a developing app needs improvement keep it up
4,good apphelps you keep track of your schedule well
4,used it app for years very good
4,i guess it works but i am struggling to see how i can make it remind me everyday to do something and then mark it as done design needs improvement not appealing and a bit confusing it may be very useful if you find an use for it
4,very wonderful experience i had plenty of difficulties trying to manage my time and the experience was totally wonderful and worthwhile just 1 thing though add something so that on weekends it automatically switches to weekend schedule you guys could do just that  other than that 1010 experience
4,still learning but so far seems to meet my needs
4,really good app with a major flaw you should be able to save your routines and be able to recover them in case of crash new phone and be able to use them in other platforms with sync
4,thats exactly ehat i need but after setting an activity it come backs to blocks page and its so bothering
4,nice to manage time but you should work on notifications the notifications set before time appear on time of tasks and custom tunes dont work apart from these app is well made and helpful
4,i need more than 15 days in atypical routine actually i need 28 days 7x4 i work 7 days in the morning and 7 in the evening and 7 at night
4,activity in routine and block should be sync so it will not show duplicate activites and it will be great it the app can show report by week month year
4,great app exactly what i wanted but it needs frequent troubleshooting owing to some reason unknown to me also the programme facility needs subscription which is not economically viable for students like me
4,its a great application for time management but the only thing bothering me is that every time i have to do this thing like refresh your background tasksand the app doesnt work unless i refresh the background tasks  can you help me with this please 
4,app is very good for use mentioned but the permanent notification not showing many times when any saved task is happening i have checked all settings like no restrictions for battery saving etc but still permanent notification gone for no reason please improve for showing notifications on time also if we have not opened app within few hours
4,this is a good app for setting up a daily routine it could be a bit more intuitive to use and i would like to have the ability to copy and paste repeat daily activities rather than to entering them one at a time but once it is set up it is very good
4,seems like a very well made app very good for if you want a rigid schedule that has plenty of options for repeating patterns one thing i would maybe look into adding would be a feature where you could set an assumed cost of an activity such as your daily lunch or dinner or maybe your commute so that you could plan your budget along with the schedule
4,its a great app if you want a calender or routine app i really like the colour coded tags for different types of activities i would love to see a separate todo list i would prefer the todo list to be separate to the calendar or have a linking capability so that when you schedule your task into your calender it disappears or you have to choice for it to disappear from the todo list
4,only hope we can adjust the daily routine time automatically in case we wake up late adjust just for the start time then the other activities below will adapt the time changes for developers the problem is solved thank you for the response 
4,overall not bad
4,this is worlds best time table app  but one problem i think time tune doesnt give me the option or i dont know how to do thisplease tell me how to send its backup thingy i spent hours to plan the perfect time table but when i got a new phone all my program was lostcan anyone tell me what or how to recover this  is it even possible edit thanks for helping 
4,good app but there are some problems which need to be solved
4,nice app not complicated at allsuper easy to usethe perfect app is here 
4,this is easy to use and i like tag that have icon its creative but i have one problem its dont have check box i want to know how motivation i am in everyday
4,all is awesome but give the app a tick  mark option that will help a lot who wants to organize their time
4,it is great aap for time management
4,it do not ring the alarm do any know why 
4,the only problem is that doesnt exist timetune for ios 
4,12best for students preparing for competitive but i hope there should be more option for different uses not fixing to only one particular requirement 22 time indicating one showing how accurately we have completed our worksassume if i make an alarm at 6 am and i woke up at 7 am that will be loss so that should be highlighted to not waste the time for next day further improvement these type of options will help us 
4,very good experience till now user friendly i like it
4,good over all but not so intuitive
4,i have been using this app for quite some time and im really enjoying it first thing in the morning i schedule my day which enables me to spend a v productive day ive become quite dependant on it id suggest to add a search option for tags i have created a bunch of tags and its really time consuming to scroll all the way over and over again to insert tags also i saw a bunch of great suggestions in the reviews and it would be great if they are implemented
4,it is very useful app
4,this app is usfull to mantain the time
4,is so beautiful and friendly but has a lot of lag edit is not lag it freezes my phone 
4,its so good
4,works good for me and my needs easy adding and pleasing and easy to use design definitely recommend checking it out
4,i like app it manages my routine and hlp me make me a good time manager
4,the app is really good  it just needs a tick box system to mark what you have done and not done  and a tracker of how many days u ticked off these routines to assess progress
4,i couldnt use this app because it is going here and there so i cant set up the time table
4,i request developer that if we can add attachments would be much helpful im ok to go for pro version of this feature comes with it pls guide me on this
4,i really like the app if only theres a tickbox so that i can check out the tasks done then itll be a 5 stars for me 
4,im missing the option to archive routines and id like to remove the first already set tag so i can have events without tags aswell as events witj tags apart of that i like this app alot ive tried alot of time planning apps with routines and i like this the best so far can recommend
4,a good app 
4,great potential im still trying to figure out the difference routines programmer and routines but hopefully this is the answer to teaching homeschool with adhd
4,goodd
4,excellent so far better to include a feature to tick off tasks as a record that it was completed
4,been looking for an app like this for a while i love being able to coordinate things with tags customizable by colours and icons i would happily give 5 stars apart from three things 1 it would be great if there was an option to mark tasks as completed 2 i dont see much of a difference between the time block and routine choices generally just looking for advice on this one and 3 it would be great if we could add more than 3 tags to a time block or routine 
4,what i miss option to edit singular block from a routine eg clear or move a routine block if an event for a given day overlaps without pausing the routine otherwise great an implementation of the mentioned feature is a surefire way to make me buy pro
4,this app is amazing it has mostly all the nessary toolsthough to make this even better you can include a timer an include it on your wallpaper  otherwise it is a really good app for everyone
4,hi i really enjoy and appreciate this app as a mobile app it works perfectly for me however id really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it im not sure if this exists already i like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere  any time however when i feel the need to adapt and change my schedule it feels a little cluttered and time consuming i frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability please consider this in future upgrades regards
4,hi i love the application i am planning to buy the pro version im just wondering if the pro version is a one time life time already
4,great app i suggest a timer on this one so we can still track our rest periods every time we take a short rest
4,i want to say just add on the feature to check the boxthings which i have done from my daily time boxing schedule
4,honestly a really good app for creating routines however id like to see a calendar view of my routines and be able to view more than the 2 weeks in the schedule tab the programmer tab is one of my favorites last thing i would like is to have activities overlap each other when creating routines instead of splitting the long activity when another activity is set to times within it
4,easy n compatible
4,fantastic app would be nice if it had a calendar feature though
4,so far so good for time management
4,great for daily planning simple and clutter free interface good to use
4,i would have given it 5 stars but after latest update 30 it takes some time to load example earlier when i wanted to change any block it would be instant editing but now i have to wait for sometime for it to load
4,absolutely love this app so much productivity
4,please just add alarm and its good easy to use the app
4,okay so far as i have used the app was pretty good i read that this is s new one and i like all the features present in it however there is still lot of room for improvement i have a small suggestion to make you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not that way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the timetable 
4,i like it very much it is very good and easy to use
4,add more icon please
4,hi i love this app but something was really not good about this app the app permission thingy i thought it was automatic but not i dont know how to possibly fix it but please fix it or help me to fix it actually i already turn on the app permission and this app was allowed but still it says it was blocked by the system hurry please i dont want to waste my time anymore
4,have found app to be quite helpful aids in developing routine and good habit patterns beneficial for developing personal discipline
4,it was wonderful but if you put checkboxes it would be better
4,love it gave it a 2nd try and it really helped me stay on track with my routine such intuitive tools and functions the only problem is that it keeps malfunctioning and doesnt update notifs or even the widget
4,good apps make my life is better but why i cant use ringtone as notification  i can only use vibration for notification
4,i like its simplicity and overall functionality ive been using it for a while i just purchased the pro version to promote support to developer just a little favor hopefully we can see the events synced from google calendars in events tab and preview the events  routines for the days ahead thanks 
4,very useful but in my case i didnt hear a costum sound even though the voice and vibration work also if i try to pick a song its usually start but the notification didnt do the same and im already check all the troubleshoot is it because costum sound cant use music
4,good app and prompt support
4,i like this app very much to create a schedule for everyday and having the reminders havent found any other app which perfectly fits my requirement like timetune but i am always facing the issue where i stop receiving the intimation and have to refresh background apps which is very annoying hope i can receive support for this issue
4,great appbut one suggestionif you could add the feature of marking whether or not we followed a particular activity in the routinethat would be greatlike if ive planned to studyi can mark whether or not i actually studiedand then it could show the statistics of how much i stuck with my routineplease consider italso you could add a goal trackerlove your app
4,this app is very useful for students and other works
4,good and most practical application but if apps widget could show date day and current task and next task only or with customization option like that this would be just awesome
4,it os the best app i ever had it is wonderful i love it
4,best time managment app
4,new update made me little bitterin routine section  kindly take it back and give the old one in the routine section  first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately  but now all the days are one by one and not side by side  actually side by side is best and easy to edit  thank you for your reply  before it was as free but now as constant ad is placed below which is so annoying
4,this is a great app highly recommended im not sure if it has a monthly routine option pls do tell about it also i would like to know if the data saved can be linked to a user account so if i change device i can continue using my routineschedule without adding all over again thanks
4,one of the cleanest uis i might have ever used i understand that the app is made for us to be able to stick to our schedules but i think its a shame theyre not letting us double its use as a time log too i think the statistics can be made more informative like graphical representations and stuff and we should also be given an option to just log in our schedules day after day without using the routines function because i have different schedules everyday
4,preety good
4,very easy to make new routines and activities if you want to organize your time a little better
4,a really awsm app to make and maintain a schedule it really helps a lot in time management
4,the background is very bland you could have more colors i also noticed that the app keeps crashing
4,best and cleanest scheduling app ive found by far it has it all multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals visually effective tags comments visible on table and notifications widget statistics events dark theme all without adding unnecessary noise using it is extremely intuitive doesnt lock any significant features behind premium wall instead theyre just extras that are nice to have which is a rarity but one thing thats missing is the ability to copy eventsactivities
4,bene ma non e possibile trovarlo sul mio smartphone huawei carica anche la tua applicazione sulla app galleria di huawei
4,great app i use timetune to time block my entire day into short segments a few fixes  when scheduling a day in advance the time autosets to 24 hours ending next day if i scheduled breakfast from 800 am to 830 am it automatically sets to 830 am the next day very tedious to change difficult to see overlapping tasks no easy way to push an entire schedule back if you are late on one item and need to push everything by 10 min for example you have to change each manually
4,i like this app i am just unsure whether i can sync one profile on two devices i dont want to purchase the pro version for both my devices and have to set up my different routines for each app
4,they should make a website that is in sync with your phone
4,troubleshooting problem unable to notify events on time if these problems are sorted this application is very useful best for people who want a timetable application that is simple and easy to use
4,hi  i use this app to manage my studying and it works very nice but if it had a calendar it would be excellent if you can  please add a nice calendar to the app that it shows our tasks too  thanks for your amazing app
4,i wish this app was available on ipad
4,its good but i think it would be better if the routines could be sorted
4,i like and immediately boight the pro
4,mast hai bhai
4,i really like this app for my phone my favorite part is the voice notification it really helps with my kids homeschooling i set the voice to tell them that its time for school and to sit at the table then it plays a little song i love this because now when they hear this they turnoff their morning cartoons put their dishes in the sink grab their notebooks then sit at the table i love that i dont have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore the only thing i would suggest is having the option to make my schedule on the computer too and be able to link the two devises like how google does with their calendar app other than that i really like this app
4,i love this app its very helful for me to do my routine
4,i wish i could donate in exchangefor getting rid of the ad at the bottom
4,i just started using this one thing i would like to see is the ability to add check boxes to an event for example i have a time slot labeled housework scheduled from 11am to 12pm i would like to be able to tap on that block of time and see that i need to do dishes vaccume and dust in that time frame and be able to mark off each task as it is complete
4,amazing app really organized i do think the app should be a little bit more colourful and have a more minimalist design and should stop shutting down in the background after like 5 hours
4,the only schedule app i undrstoodeasy to use
4,everything is up to mark just the feature persistent notification sometimes doesnt show up i would request the timetune maintainers to please check this otherwise i love this app 
4,it was really helpful to keep track of what i have to do everyday i think that it is easy to use and it could be even better one day
4,realmente ayuda mucho me sirvió bastante pero parece haber un problema con las notificaciones sonoras solo me avisa visualmente por eso lo califico como 4 estrellas
4,only just started using this app looks good but it would be great to have a calender view so that you can easily see whats coming up in the month edit i will go as far as to say that i will end up deleting this app even though i already paid for it if there isnt a calender view added eventually
4,very useful app for routine planning loved it 
4,love the appany chance well be getting an ios version of it too and be able to sync everything across all devices maybe even a desktop version of the app
4,new to the app but it looks very useful based on what ive seen thus far im looking for an option were saved routines can be implemented into the daily schedule but are also tied to a kind of countdown timer that corresponds to the specific routine added eg impromptu select laundry and its automatically integratedlayered onto present schedule w a countdown clock allowing for whatever amount of time you preset for that routine if it hadhas that then its five stars for me
4,grt
4,i love how many options you have for setting notifications my fasting routine notifies me at the start 30 mins before it ends and when it ends very cool the app is missing two pretty big features though 1 the ability to see how your routines overlap right now its completely unintuitive you basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2 an indication for what the current time is again math in your head a schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time
4,this app was quite useful to have and something i think that i needed the only thing that put me off was the premium  it slightly ruins it so i would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if i would change something about this app other than that quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day
4,amazing app it easily allows you to manage routines and plan your day the only thing i would add is the ability to write tasks and then have the ability to add them to the schedule
4,how do you decrease the timing of the alarmmy only question
4,i really liked this app this helps me remember things on time but the only problem is that it doesnt give pop up or notification sound so every time ive to check my next task
4,very nice app easy to use the best organizer to do reminder its like having a complete pack with u but only thing is you have to put some efforts and time in typing ur routines
4,this is my first time using a scbedule app and i love it so far however im a little bit confused on how its supposed to work im able to set up routines for everyday instead for single days in a week im asking this because when i made my routines for monady everything went smoothly but when the next day comes my routines arent showing up at my schedule anymore do i have to set up the routines for each day for my routines to be at the schedule or is there a better option
4,its been super helpful during this homeschooling process however sometimes the notifcation sound just keeps going and the only way to shut it off is to stop what im doing and go into the app itself it wont let me remove it from my notifications during these times either its not everytime just sometimes
4,its good for now but i wish there was a way of crossing out the tasks or things ive already done and also to be able to put tags when its not a routine
4,the app really nicei request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders
4,i loved the app its unreal the only reason i give it four stars is because i would add a section with to do list opcions for the tasks that doesnt have an specific time do that and ill give you five stars
4,really beneficial it allows me to follow my routines efficiently
4,the alarm sound doesnt work so i could not know it already the time
4,i miss the timer function please put it back reply to developers suggestion for a new pomodoro timer unless its markedly better than the hundreds of timer apps available in the store and at a more competitive price i wouldnt consider a new timer app from you as it stands now ive held back from upgrading to the revamped version on one of my phones as it takes away functions including the timer a feature that makes the old app stand out and superior to the deluge of other similar apps
4,really good app for organizing your daily routines definitely worth getting wish simultaneous activities were better displayed though
4,its well put together i think it works very well for that its for and can help provide structure to your day the next step for the app is to incorporate goals and goal metrics help me track if im getting 8 hours of sleep a night or studying 12 hours a week
4,great app with widget some more but i wish can add in all day event so that i can include daily task
4,not complete but nice
4,even after buying it displays ads and says it is a free version after some time it is working  got an technical support too from the app manufacturer tq
4,lovely and simple
4,i will like one more option in settings  calendar sync  checkbox push events to google calendar  i know its not good to receive notifications from two places but on galaxy phones always on display shows only events that are listed in google calendar or samsung calendar app and i really like my schedule on always on display screen please do it this will help all galaxy users
4,this is the app ive been looking for but theres still room for improvement first off when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry second there is a lack of flexibility there should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves
4,its a great app but it would be even better if there was an option to see the whole week schedule in one place i hope you guys will add such an option in further updates 
4,have relied on this app for work since it 1st came out great for project management  trackingbudgeting time requests  please bring back hourly repeat function ie set an event to repeat every 3 hours it was a useful interval timer  chrome extension or online version as paid user id pay more for this  increase maximum  of days for atypical routines with option to create monthly routines  sync google tasks  reminders in addition to events 2way sync wgoogle thanks
4,so much effective app
4,its great really been helping me keep tract of time and doing school work the only problem im having is having a notification sound i get a notification but theres no sound and i dont notice it my sound is turned all the way up and i havent silenced them
4,i understand the function of the switch what i meant is that once i had attended to a reminder i could delete it so that i could remain with a clean slate for future use now combining events and reminders makes it hard to have a clean slate at the beginning of each day cause you cant delete recurring events i just want reminders tab thats separate from events so that i can always clean my reminders up at the end of each day and know which ones need to be done the next the app was so elaborate when events and reminders were separate functions
4,its a nice app with a simple interface the widget is also very useful however i think it lacks a daily or weekly to do list
4,very useful app and some understandable problems with notifications
4,this app is great from a students perspective i love how you can make different schedules like one for this and one for that its so easy and user friendly i  it one thing they should add is a way that i can access this app with my schedules on both my phone and tablet without having to copy out the entire schedule again 
4,this app is super useful to keep me scheduled i only have the free version but its still really useful i like how it looks and how i can look at how much time i put into certain activities i also like how i can set multiple notifications for the same activity you can also change each individual notification however you want the app is very user friendly i would definitely recommend 
4,i want to make a weekly habit routine but theres not any option to choose the name of the weeks and plan please add that option instead of day 1 day 2 add sunday monday and a option to choose first day of the week thanks
4,its really a good app to track your daily routine and set reminders but i will be more satisfied if it gets upgrade to a more better look and more tracking options
4,simple and nice can add up little more
4,i miss the old lay out of lines instead of squares on the daily calendar now it feels like google calendar wish they gave the option of choosing the display layout
4,update it would make more sense to have the schedule tab as just the schedule layed out where you have the time of day scale to the left  editable show just hours or hours and minutes and then the activity from the routines at the correct time and the only way to edit the routine could be only through the routine tab as thats where i assume you want the main part to edit routines to be but i love how you can save different routines for each day not to sure what programmer is for
4,very nice app i liked it
4,this app for students are xawesome but the thing i dont like is that there is no tracker i cant see the what i did in the last week other wise the various options for alarm and the stickers are perfect
4,nice app but online synchronization and cloud connection is required in case we miss the phone its very important today
4,it is very helpful app
4,this apps quite easy to use and looks simple just it doesnt really meet my requirements it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox ive purchased it but it still like the same it said sync to my calendar but it didnt shows what ive planned in my google calendar the only thing i am satisfield is the notification sounds
4,not upto the mark but its okay ads give ptoblem and ui is little weak
4,developer responded to my issue quickly and politely app is pretty good so far maybe a little more clarity is needed about the user interface for dummies like me  like an arrow to indicate i can swipe for the rest of my schedule
4,i think the app really helps you stay organized it really helped me out the only complaint i have it that you have to pay for the premium version but i mean how else are you supposed to be able to make money off of an app so
4,real good you star focus on you schedule and all the dead times
4,make some more widgets rest all app is nice and userfriendly
4,can sync it to laptop
4,i love this app and the idea behind it with the weekly and daily routines i wish i could view my month or week at a glance however so i can see my weekly routine and how my non reoccurring events affect and lay out with my routine
4,decent
4,easy to use and very useful especially spending lots of time at home at the moment
4,a great app but i miss a overview of week activitys the app get confusing to use after adding some tasks
4,this app is great so far but i wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine if there is already pls let me know
4,fine app would be perfect to have desktop web version also to make adding routine much easier
4,amazing helps manage your time and habit formation
4,good app and really helpful with time management and staying organized
4,its simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines
4,nāo é exatamente oque estou procurando
4,its an excellent app but i would ditch the ads you shouldnt need theme with a premium version available they make your app look cheap and distract users
4,nice app it helps a lot to save time you will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time
4,beautiful app for personal growthv
5,this helps me so much thank you
5,shiv raj singh
5,this is an amazing app highly recommended for schedules it has dailyweekly and atypical schedules and notifications and pop ups too

5,well
5,this is such a great app unfortunately i am planning to move to iphone and this is not available on the app store really breaks my heart
5,this app is very helpful for study  so this app is very helpful for me
5,the app is exactly what i was searching for since a long long time it would be even better if there was some web app or desktop app for it
5,best app for schedule making
5,as someone who procrastinates constantly and needs a routine to keep myself focused this app is amazing the constant notification with personalized icons makes it so easy and helpful to keep track of whats going on and what i need to do next no this app isnt perfect but ive found great use from it i recommend getting the pro version its only 5 dollars and the programmer is super useful 
5,best 
5,a great app but it would be nice to add a feature to plan a schedule for tomorrow any further date on the day before making a schedule the night before for next day is a hassle it keeps reverting back to routines and the current day everytime pressing schedule and swiping to change date is time consuming to add blocks
5,brilliant app exactly what i was looking for heart felt appreciation for the team involvedthank you
5,its really a great appbut after recent updateit lost some featuresits not highlighting the current task in schedule panneladd this feature again in the next update edit  there is no  now icon on the top barby the waythe method of highlighting the current task in schedule option before this update was better than the present way of highlighting its better to highlight the whole sentence instead of highlighting only the borders
5,thanks timetune been using ur app since 2018  i achieved 1st place at local singing competition since you always remind me to practice  u always reminded me to work out at gym now im in a better shape  i made my clients happy because i arranged all my responsibilities fit their needs at a perfect time thanks will abosulely still using this when alien invade the earth one day
5,i think this app will be amazing by seeing the reviews i hope that it will be superb i give 5 stars because it is like this app i was finding 
5,loving the app itd be amazing if you could do calendar integrations with outlook gmail so that my work appointments could be reflected automatically
5,time to pick my life up and awaken my life
5,good app will there be a way to input a hex code for the color to the widget in a future update

5,just started and i finding this very easy operate thank you
5,i love this app i have been able to put my life together just by the free features of this app i would always stress about having to do certain things everyday i wouldnt do them because i had to remember to do them every day because of this app i dont have to remember to do them i get reminded to do them and i do them happily if i hadnt found this app i dont know if i would have ever put my life together

5,what an app
5,great app absolutely love using it to plan out my day thank you
5,it works perfectly for us the best app
5,ive only just started using this app but it seems to be exactly what i was looking for it allows you to create customised event types programme start and end times for events set repeating events its simple but not lacking in features one suggestion i have is the ability to see a weekly view of the schedule
5,it is quite good for managing your schedule and having your schedule written down somewhere instead of it being in your head you could definitely use it for your professional life i only use it for personal
5,its amazing i like the way it is so dont try anything odd soon i will try the premium
5,best of its kind

5,finally found what im looking for great app
5,make for ios please
5,i just came back from a year or more of not using the app i didnt really have a routine and ive gotta say the design changes are amazing its visually easier to navigate and edit the ideas in blocks are great cant wait to see you implement more things to do with overlaps and such
5,this app is freaking phenomenal instead of having a billion alarms in my phone that i have to go over all the time i can just set up schedules and go about my day i have my daughters school schedule since were distance learning my sons band schedule my work routine even simple things like when to brush my teeth so nothing gets missed in the chaos that is quarantine life i have adhd so being hyperorganized is super important for me and this app cuts out so much stress
5,i like the way
5,clean  straightforward interface the widget is transparent in my homescreen which i really liked maybe adjusting the tags in two columns looks much more cleaner anyways thanks for this app
5,love it  recently buy pro version 
5,i have updated routines and enabled it in programmer i dont see any in my schedules schedules is totally blank later it got updated so changing review to little better because but from the previous design to now i feel like i have to enter so much something is wrong with the app
5,best app of time management
5,this app is my second brain i realy love it and he help me to organize my life
5,nice love the new update gud ui nd very user friendly thnk u very much  keep up the gud work and keep updating just love it
5,very extensive in how you can plan things out and make routines its very nice
5,sangat membantu sekali
5,its awesome that it is free for all of the things that it offers such a great app
5,this app is my life literally my watch reminds me of the next part of my day blocking out time each day for what matters helps me get everything done as a working mom wife and dog owner that means everything 
5,good job keep up the great work
5,i loved this all before but with the new updates it is the best i lose track of time easily and this allows me to make a schedule and choose which items give a notification this helps me so much to stay on track throughout the day perfect for an adhd brain im a homeschool mom with a busy schedule and i struggle to keep the household running efficiently this app is a gift to me additionally  i havent encountered a single ad  welldesigned app hugs to the developers
5,i like this
5,perfeito demanda um pouco de paciência para dominar o aplicativo porém nada mais justo isso porque o aplicativo apresenta inúmeras funções e diferente dos demais simples não deixa nada a desejar
5,its a perfect time scheduling app 
5,in india now most of the people do their work digitally earlier we wrote time table on a paper but now we can do this with apps but usually we so not find perfect apps for such things but this app is all time perfect for time management
5,great app it helps me to manage my time well
5,nice and good looking interface  personally liked it 
5,one of the best
5,very useful app it is possible to set a very useful study schedulethank you 
5,i have remote learners and this app is so helpful when keeping track of their school schedule highly recommended i have the free version so im not sure if the pro version allows you to designate a specific routine within a specific date within a calendar app but i can import a specific routine per day with the free version and its been very useful
5,supperb
5,amazing appnice work dev
5,this app is my saviour during quarantine now that i have a schedule whats up next in the day my anxiety level has gone way down im so glad i downloaded this app i love how on top of notifications theres a voice saying aloud to whats coming up a minor issue is that reading is pronounced reding great app
5,my favourit good
5,simple and easy to use i only wished i could see it in a calendar view
5,i absolutely love timetune easy to follow interface nice colors and super efficient check it out and if you like it the pro version is so worth it thankyou timetune 
5,best time table app but required below functions which i really needs auto copy previous routines and time for upcoming suggestions  connect social media or make personal log in account  send routine data to trainer or teacher through email in pdf or docs etc save data into pdf to make printed chart adding images into routines cloud saving
5,after trying a lot of time blocking apps to do lists i hav came down to this app its very convenient
5,great app but id like to make a suggestion have an option to set the default day on custom routines to day 1 when activated it currently defaults to which ever day you closed the app and as such some of my alarms dont go off because they are on day 1 and the routine gas started on day 2
5,it really helps if you are trying to build a system  routine using the routine feature wich can be applied and customised in the schedule section  it would be cool if u can add an infinite subsubtasks  thanks developers great job 
5,this app helps me to be more oganized
5,best time management app on playstore  hands down
5,its the best best app ever
5,just starting using it and i can already tell how great it is at keeping you on schedule ive done schedules before but with this app it makes it so much easier to stay on track 
5,i love this app is really good and easy to use but i dont know why im having problems it seems that my phone blocked the app or the notifications are turn off but i already turn them on but it keeps saying it isnt working i need some help anyways the app is excellent
5,absouletely incredible
5,best try that
5,i love this app it is so helpfull
5,i have been using this application for 1 week i am giving five stars to this application because after downloading this application i am getting my work done on time i have benefited a lot from this application people who want to do their work at certain times and change their lives do download this application
5,easy to use manageable time management
5,i have been trying this app for 4 days and its really effective thankyou developers for making this appi hope you will make ot even better in the upcoming days 
5,this app helps you edit your routine anytime as per one flexible timethis is very useful for people like me who find it difficult to follow a routine but helps us to be on track and guides us to know what to do next you can alot time at irregular basis eg a task can be for 20 mins whereas the other could be for 90 mins the notification are at par and do good job at reminding us our next task the information that one needs to fill in when adding a task is accurate and is easy this app is the best one and would not like to replace it with any other to use for my studies also for this reason i would be looking forward to an app for the pcs or at least a web
5,overall i like the latest update its perfect for making schedules i do wish the blocks had two catagories past  upcoming so i dont have to scroll past old events to get to my current events i also wish blocks still had the personal icons instead of only tags
5,this is a really really great app 
5,nice scheduler but i hope in the future there would be a clock shaped schedule as a widget
5,really competent scheduling app worth premium imo would be improved if i could edit from a webapp and it could do browser notifications actually even just editing from a browser and doing notifications from my phone would be super helpful
5,as a person with autism and adhd this is great started using it today somehow got the pro version even though i dont remember paying cant see any faults yet and if i do ill let the devs know

5,amazing app it is best for your whole planning 
5,love it simple  efficient
5,i want to say only one thing that is this app is to good  because second thing u will know when you install it
5,it is so far a good app hopefully it keeps me on track
5,absolutely love this i love that you can copy schedules so you dont have to keep doing repeats i cant wait to see what else this can do
5,this app is perfect for someone like me who forgets everything it helps structure my weekly routines so that i dont have to stress about remembering all kinds of different tasks and helps clear my mind for more important things 
5,made my day efficient thank you 
5,fabulous app thare is all type for making schedule  very helpful app for me 
5,very nice app not irritating and helping students really
5,this app is just amazing
5,great app its absolutely perfect for what i do the only gripe is that the comment section on the schedule block could be bigger it limits me and i cant jot down everything i can i hope the developers will see this message and extend it as i think its an easy fix and would benefit a lot of users very much thanks
5,i reallly liked this app for my phone and i also suggest all to download the app fastly my words are less to describe the app and it is really the best app and brilliant app
5,the design looked much better before especially the widget wish there was a way to switch to previous design edit  it seems that the widget design is growing on me so i changed the rating functionally the app is still great
5,awesome app really i didnt think id be able to manage my schedules and daily routines so easily ui is really valued here you really have to use this app now
5,incredible scheduling app its like having your own diary secretary keep up the good work please provide the option to back up in the cloud
5,i needed a simple app that i can schedule my day throughout this has a very simple interface and a very visually appealing aesthetic i love it so far what would really fit the bill even better is if i can drag and drop blocks sometimes i have to shift priorities and it messes up my schedule and i need to manually go in and change things in every block thereafter
5,now that ive been using this app for a while i dont know how id survive without it keeps me on track and motivated and is just plain simple while also attractive no annoyances easy to customize love it
5,i love how simple it is to schedule your activities for the day
5,very useful and nice features helps create a routined lifestyle
5,this app is useful for students
5,so far this app is the bestits helping
5,promising
5,love the app it serves its purpose well ive found that routines are a must for effective and long term habit building the latest update allows 2 tags per time slot which is awesome but the notes now visually appear seperate or disconnected from the timeslot and tag its really just an aesthetic issue but i do wish it were fixed
5,the app is very handy and helpful but the tag break cant be removed and it occures in every task planned that makes the good visuals unhelpful and confusing if that would work 5 stars
5,очень хорошее и удобное приложение
5,just downloaded this app and set up everything in a snap super easy to use and customize hours multiple timetables tags etc only had it for 20 minutes but love it so far update aug 2020 the ui seems to be unnecessarily cluttered since the latest update i loved the ease and simplicity and it was the only app that gave me exactly what i was looking for a simple clean flexible timetabling app not a calendar or a to do list now it seems like theyre trying to fit too much into the app
5,op bolte
5,very very very very very very very very very very very very very helpful app
5,best app for planning and to make us follow it
5,one of the best if not the best schedule app with a lot of customisation 
5,it took me a bit to get the hang of doing schedules that dont happen on a regular interval but now i love this app i use it everyday to keep me on top of what i need to be doing i think its going to be very useful for when school starts up this fall considering all of my classes are thru distance learning
1,you have to pay extra to continue after a free trial
1,why have i been logged out and cant reset my password to get back in
1,id love to use this app if there was any other payment method than with a credit card which i dont have and dont want
1,its not free
1,thiefs i cancelled last year after my free trial and they still took 3500 and refused to refund my money i verified it was cancelled and woke up this morning to them stealing another 3500 i dont even use their crappy product oh and there is no way besides email to get ahold of them
1,downloaded free trial and looked at it first day and it wasnt really easy to use so didnt look at it again i had no correspondence from them to tell me that the trial was over and that they were going to take the money i find that deceptive behaviour as they are banking o people forgetting to cancel
1,although itspretty i did not use it so cancelled the subscription they have billed me again for this even though cancelled through their service and following their instructions on how to do it so ensure you use a payment method they cant override
1,deceiving little app nowhere in your app or youtube commercial did it state that for the first 2 week trial that you needed a credit card on file i can not use the 2 week trial unless i have a credit card on file that really sucks why call it a trail its more like an ambush
1,i cant pay for it it says platform error something about iap not prepared so cant do free trial eitherplease help
1,why why why let us try it without forcing us to pay first you just lost a customer
1,hate
1,did not like this at all difficult to sync with all my different calendars and limited formatting and design options as well also hard to unsubscribe very round about process i do not recommend this
1,tried to put in my first event and it failed to log it i uninstalled it same day
1,theres one thing that makes me crazy about apps its when their developers dont tell you up front what the cost is of after the free trial so i wont be trying this as much as id like to
1,i did the free trial this planner does not have push notifications you can set up your events and appointments even make them reoccurring but artful agenda app will not remind you or notify you what good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications if i am going to pay for an app it should at least have most of the features a free app has
1,my events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when theyve been manually entered whats the point of a planner that doest let you plan
1,if this was free yeah id totally use this who honestly wants to pay to keep track of your life wth
1,only option is paid subsctiption app no thanks i cant constantly pay for apps within my budget so id much rather have the option to use a version with ads
1,update after i read the reply i redownloaded this app waste of 425 its not worth any amount of money not a lot of extras to charge money and its only cute on a computer the lists are not very easy to make and i never did find the meal plan or journal parts the goal part is not on the app anydo is free and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar not worth the cost yeah its cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars pretty disappointed
1,terrible i transferred all my lists from google to this app do they would all be in one place and they didnt save so beyond frustrating
1,app install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks so you have to pay to use this app this is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install
1,i downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it looked cool so i figured try it out right until i downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription lady you are nuts people rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper you do not see the full texture of the book its an online planner on top of it im not paying you for that i downloaded a free calendar that does the exact same thing terrible marketing skills
1,could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesnt mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid
1,it wouldnt let me try the app it just told me to subscribe
1,slow on laptop does not sync with website no stickers on app just laptop i set up my calander on my ohone then went to desktop i cant open up my calander unlesss i give payment info on laptop i already set up payment in google play and to get to that screen takes a long time
1,you cant even try it out they are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything
1,this is a pay to play calendar only
1,this app is a total ripoff i stupidly paid for the onetime subscription of 3500 had the app less than one hour the print was so tiny i could barely see it a lesson learned the hard wayno more app subscriptions for me users beware forewarned is forarmed hang on to your wallets if you try out this app
1,doesnt work error messages appear everywhere when i open the app
1,always freezing
2,i had to uninstall this app and cancel my subscription not only did this app slow my phone and cause glitches but the second i uninstalled it my phone went back to normal with no issues the concept is great and im sure it works well on apple products but without a dark mode in 2020 no ability to use a stylist note 9 to write notes and i cannot add multiple google and microsoft calendars to the agenda it does less than the calendar my phone came with this just doesnt do enough for me
2,its 2020 and theres no dark theme for this are you serious i can make it tolerable on desktop by forcing a dark theme but i cant on my phone this is a huge dealbreaker for me accessibility is a real thing devs
2,i just signed up and i cant even access anything keeps saying error code 7
2,looks pretty but when exchanged to canadian its too expensive almost 50yr not even worth checking out the free trial since theres no way i can maintain that
2,i wanted to love it and i did until i needed to add my other gmail accts to it damn near impossible i am currently in the 2 wk trial i reached out to tech support asking for an explanation on how to sync my other accounts as all of the app tutorials didnt mention how they sent me back a link to a faq telling me what to do but not how to do it every google search had me come up short i give up cancelling my default calendar syncs em all just fine wish i had the pretty stickers etc
2,while in looks this app is lovely it had a big issue for me price i am always looking for an android replacement for goodnotes an ios exclusive app i use for digital planning visualy the app is beautiful and it seemed to be very well put together but be willing to pay 40 a year special price monthly 499 in the current state of peoples pandemic budget personally i feel its way to expensive heck goodnotes is 10 once with updates am i missing something happy planner 20 even
2,i was interested in this app until i had to put in my credit card for a free trial without even knowing the price
2,dont like not being able to even look at the app without credit card entry and account sign up
2,i really like the apponline portal but having everything in one does me no good wo push notifications  i wish this had a widget so i didnt have to open the app to look at everythingi paid for this  i dont feel like i got my investment back as i maybe use the app once in a blue moon it looks great but it just doesnt work to what i feel is its full protein i hope you add this  dont make me pay for it
2,there is a subscription to the service i wish i would have knownbefore i downloaded looks beautiful though
2,love it and its good start to build on but there appears to be syncing issues between calendars no matter how many times i refresh im going to give it time before i give up on it im big on my happy planner and would totally ditch it for this if it had similar features such as a budget planner one could add i wouldnt use most of the stickers which is unfortunate because i love my stickers in my planners overallgood start
2,absolutely no mention of paying to use this app until youve downloaded it and signed up too bad it looked pretty
2,okay if you like planning with google its exactly like that just prettier i dont see how this can replace a paper planner at all
3,edited three stars because it could use some improvements like ability to select text cutcopy and paste it only gives the select all option ability to drag items on lists mobile would be good too these work fine on the web but not mobile the app is gorgeous great sync with google calendar  visually pleasing but too many glitches on my end including web app things not updating making what you just typed disappear or not deleting when you try to delete may retry in future
3,i have downloaded it on my samsung tabs6 i have added an event to repeat however it is not showing anywhere but search bar much frustration also cannot get it to work on macbook like tutorial in app store can someone possibly help
3,uhmmhello creator i just want to ask when i opened the app it glitches and it will turn back to my home please fix this thank you
3,very tempting appl the the theme is geat however using preset handwriting styles might be a bit risky
3,i am currently in the free trial period i have been in constant contact with tech support as my calenders wont sync technology support have been wonderful but too difficult for me to sort out with the time differences the app on the mobile is slow to update changes i love the colours and writing but functionally it is a bit sluggish for the price i am still considering continuing once the trial is over but not sure
3,id give it a 5 if it had some additional features like the ability to search your notes by hashtags or keywords also it works with my note 8 but writing on the screen is a little clunky it could be easier to write on screen
3,so far i love the layout and look im not giving it 5 yet but will update as i use it more i dont like that if i click on my notification that it opens the event to save or delete i stead of just looking at it or giving me the option to complete my other issue is not being able to change the time i want an all day reminder again i love it so far but would like to see that changed
3,why cant i get it to open up on my chromebook it stays in a phone formatso disappointed
3,the app needs reminders for appointments i like the stickers but need more variety
3,it needs the ability to put stickers on the priorities and tasks also needs push notifications for reminders of events its essentially just a pretty google calendar with less customization and automatic features
3, im used to goodnote best app ever artagenda is 3 star for me can be better but not worth paying r580 a year is too much
3,im really glad someone is making an app like this but it feels like a very early version and it makes more sense to have a kickstarter instead of subscription if you need the cash for primary development loads more customization is needed including a allowing uploads for your own artwork for covertheme b ability to adddelete the modules you need delete at least  i dont track water so its a waste for me and c landscape mode i plan to follow development though and good luck
3,downloaded it because i love that it has a weekly monthly and daily goal views also lists and water intake goals but it doesnt have push notifications and it seems like i cant cross off events only goals or tasks and thats a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen
3,it would be good if it was a free app i understand in app purchases but only if the app itself was free
3,i just got this app about 2 days ago i love it i would give it   if the developers added new features such as more affordable 20year more stickers love variety journaling pages  customizable to be added anywhere within the planner fully customizable upcoming event pages to help plan for weddings anniversaries birthdays graduations parent to be planning  baby or adopted child showers valentines marriage proposal 
3,great concept the idea of this is great but theres a couple things that need work and i have a few ideas app is very slow or laggy sometimes it wont let me click on the sugested address also would be useful to be able to click address in planner and pull up directions in google map i would also like to be able to link a list to a event and or address would also like to be able to build my desired layout more themes and stickers
3,needs a widget once it has multiple different widgets calendar to do list grocery listetc i might revisit it
3,love your hard work but its there a widget with the calendar open
3,there were a lot less options for handwriting covers and stickers than i anticipated for something you want me to pay an annual or monthly subscription for its a great concept but the execution fell short for me
3,i like this better then the calendar that comes on my phone but its too pricey i dont mind paying for an app i like or paying for the downloads i want in an app but you cant justify this price for what you get
3,love it so far wish it had a widget for android though
3,i wanted to play with it for a few minutes before putting in my payment info i realize i can cancel but would prefer to do a quick test first i
4,i think this is a great start to a product i would love to see more features specifically features that let you link between lists and the planner sections features that let you have subordinate lists save information from a website or even be able to create a task or a goal directly from your email or a website
4,i had just downloaded the app on my phone and wasnt able to log in on my pc i contacted customer service who we were quick to answer and very friendly having used it i am pretty much in love it makes me feel like i am holding a paper planner in my hands the only thing i would want to add is a place to log my physical activities other than that i am in love
4,i just downloaded this app and already love it the themes and fonts are so cute and the modules for lists is amazing i am pleased with the agenda and monthly widget options for my android as i like to use one full screen on my phone for a monthly calendar widget view it is disappointing however that stickers arent visible on the widget view the stickers allow me to identify categories of events quickly and clearly and without them it just looks like google calendar
4,amazing agenda except that it doesnt have a habit tracker included if it did it would of been perfect
4,i have a love hate relationship with this app hate because sometimes i cant open the app for days on end and customer service just completely ignores you love however because they add amazing features and new fontscovers regularly it is a beautiful and functional app it is indeed beautiful and syncs well between my husbands gmail calendar and artful agenda i hope the last few bugs get fixed soon
4,really enjoying using this planner and now my lists and tasks can repeat it is slowly replacing my old calendar and todo apps altogether
4,ive only had this planner a day but so far i love it i need to be organized and have several calendars including a paper calendar but can never find a digital one i like i love being able to customize the look i also like the menu option as i usually write my menu in my paper planner and on a wall calendar its nice to see on my computer or desktop and keep track of for shopping ill update when ive used it for longer but so far i really enjoy my first impression
4,i really like this app so far ive been using it a week now and it does everything i need it to do i normally use the astaire bullet journal method with a rolling weekly task list but im still able to make a weekly task list and assign tasks to certain days i can also migrate the ones that dont get done i will certainly keep this app and dont mind the subscription because it works so well for me ill check back in again in a few weeks
4,great so far i recommend having the lists saved offline since i went to the grocery store  there was no signal so my list didnt load that was inconvenient i use it for priority tasks for the day meal plans and different colors  stickers
4,i really really like it simple to use and it seems to be syncing ok love the colors and how it looks in my windows 10 browser look forward to updates like new stickers in the future
4,updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live not fully developed this app could be great but in their rush to put it out the features are highly lacking no push notifications you cannot upload stickers no widget pretty buggy i really liked the idea of it but it needs improvement i will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added they did reach out to me to resolve my issues so i am updating to three stars
4,love the app  was able to download it to my iphone i went to download it to my samsung tablet but once i hit open all i get is black screen i uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and it still wont work
4,plz 1widget that shows the current date list of upcoming events 1 click option to open calendar 2ability to set remindersalerts for scheduled events 3 ability to sync to phones stock calendar android 4additional settings ability to customize the color of the circle indicating current date 5 ability to actually see the inspirational quotes in the app even if a new tab was necessary 6ability to create tasks and designate their priority as high low or routine along with the option
4,could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker but its a great start
4,love the look of this agenda list feature is great way to track  complete to do lists
4,i love the concept  look of this mobile app  the desktop version i wish i could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks you also cant set reminders if you add an event directly into artful agenda you have to add it to your google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to artful agenda ive paid for the year subscription  im really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or i wont be renewing
4,like the app but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times
4,i love this app it makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty it allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake your to do lists grocery lists events whatever you have in mind i find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity i only wish there were a widget available
4,i live this calendar app but i wish it was a widget
4,so far i really like it when will the stickers and tablet features be ready
4,just installed love that syncs with google wish the mobile app allowed screen rotation wish i could zoom on the week a month view i understand mobile i in beta looking forward to the evolution
4,love it so far i would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day for example they are listed in the order you enter them but i want my am on the top of each page and my pm appointments in the afternoon on the month view it would be great if you can just drag and drop i also would like a printing feature for my lists so that i can actually print them out while packing
5,love it i hope we get more stickers but its great
5,great app  on a tablet however i have one issue when i create a repeated task say to repeat daily when i check it completed the first time all subsequent days are checked complete this defeats the purpose of creating a repeating task hope you guys can fix it love the service
5,your life will be changed by this app i have always used paper planners ive also used digital planners i also have my digital calendars this app takes all of those platforms and makes a beautiful pastry you need a list theyve got lists and stickers really its a no brainer
5,i love this app and have almost been converted to digital rather than a paper planner and thats purely because i enjoy spending afternoons designing and stickering a paper planner i love the stickers and the changeable covers i also love that you can pick handwriting ive been using it for a few months now and am paying but so far theres been no problems with it and it gets up dated with new stuff regularly whether you prefer using a digital planner or not get this youll love it
5,this is the best purchase ive made this year i love planners but this one is my favorite i can organize on my laptop and take it to go with my phone its cute and pretty and there are so many cover options the whole thing syncs with google calendar and i love that about it if youre on the fence take a risk you wont regret it 
5,i love this planner i finally feel like i am truly organized the widget feature is amazing because i am easily able to see whats on the agenda the push notifications are great i have this on my phone laptop and tablet plus it is so cute
5,user friendly all the things i look for in a paper agendanow on my phone
5,tip top customer service great just a bit expensive
5,love this app so much i used to be a happy planner person but it took to much work to make things pretty before functional this agenda puts everything at my fingertips plus has beautiful layouts and stickers so many great features i am a digital agenda convert thanks to artful agenda
5,i had 2 digital and 2 paper calendars before artful agenda not anymore artful agenda combines the best of paper  visual attractive stickers and colors  with the best of digital  space for everything invite others link to video directions viewing all of your calendars together or view just one always available and of course reminders the annual subscription is less than most yearly planners but allows you to plan years out if you want try it
5,i stumbled upon this site as an ad popped up on my instagram feed normally i would scroll past but something caught my eye and im so very glad that i followed the link  i signed up instantly as i too have been searching for something less mundane and more customisable than google calendar and this meets all my expectations just perfectly i am telling all my friends and just bought my mum a subscription for her birthday as shell love it thank you for inventing it youve made my year

5,the best agenda ever love this app
5,this is everything ive been looking for the price is reasonable considering the amount i spend on paper journals and supplies it actually probably saves me the response from reps is amazing sure theres more room for improvement but you can absolutely see the work they are doing and the ears they have on their customers to continue rolling out new features that we ask for i cant wait to see how much better it continues to get im in love
5,i tried this app a long time ago and its come so far im using it to replace an analogue bullet journal and it has nearly everything i need now maybe the only thing missing would be the option to insert pictures into lists to keep track of handdrawn diagrams and stuff otherwise i love it

5,i dont do free trials where my credit card information is mandatory to try it out first edit still dont like the above but i have to say the app is about perfect for me in every way its everything i could ask for in a planner app and i love that it also integrates with outlook its brilliant and worth the money

1,best app but the phone works slowly after downloading this app i have noticed many times
1,old version is better in new version cannot backup without premium membership i am going to uninstall
1,1st time installation and i cant select my reminder alarm time to am just stuck at pm uninstalling asap bye
1,goodwas using it but now will have to leave itcoz todo backup  move to other phone have to subscribe to there monthly payment plan tata bye bye
1,bad no alarm or notification coming
1,i just like it convinient
1,became unusable after a few months
1,terrible experience if you forget to acknowledge a recurring task when it reminds you it will no longer send reminders for that task randomly changes remind me when due selection to do not remind me in one week with 4 tasks per day it has failed to remind me 9 times absolutely useless eta after the developers reply i checked my power saving and had none activated do not believe him do not buy
1,the alarm option is not alarming at the time i set up a task so sad i thought i found the right app for all my task
1,bad design makes making to do lists a monumental task
1,i hav installed just a day ago and you see how when i set alarm for today it didnt even work and ring  its just a normal app with no alarmi hate this app 
1,it was good on first daybut it did not remind me not even the first day worst app ever used 
1,subscription only you were sarcastic first with your remark about me wanting everything for free when i never said that or even implied it so you stop being sarcasticrude and stop bothering me also and ill stop bothering you if you dont want people to be rude then dont be rude to them subscription only
1,not getting notification or reminders of my tasks
1,the reminder for recuurring tasks is not working
1,i was so happy about this app to my big disappointment after i lost a lot of time to set my tasks and to prioritize i had the very unpleasant experience to have all the tasks deleted also the name of the list and no possibility to recover i do not recommend it
1,this app not sending me any notification
1,bed application
1,does not repeat every two days as set pretty damn useless uninstalled
1,very confusing only the creator knows
1,i missed something very important because this app didnt notify me the phone ran out of battery in the night  the reminder was set to 8am  and i turned on the phone at 9am apparently to this app that means to just not tell me that the reminder was supposed to go off garbage this literally didnt do the one most important thing its supposed to do
1,confusing
1,not user friendly almost impossible to delete or edit lists format is garbage
1,it is confusing i ws looking forward to get a list of tasks so tht i can mark it done or not done 2nd review after receiving feedback from dev steve steve i think i dont hv tht much time to personally write to u and i guess thts why play store has review system i hope this helps thnks if possible try to b polite to ur future customer
1,useless app it dint give any notification
1,no alarmreminder 
1,i have one old version backup file and now it is not getting restored please help
1,this app is ridiculous you cant delete tasks move the sub tasks around modify or makes notes as the project evolves its not intuitive essentially i had to write out my list on a piece of paper to build the order once it was correct then enter it to this app which makes this app pointless must be the free versions nuisance features driving you towards the paid version
1,useless app niether reminder nor notifications ping wasted too much time on ficing issue even followed developers instructions
1,how is it possible to be unable to restore my data
1,im struggling with this app im trying so hard to like it but there are basic things that i want it to do that it doesnt seem to be able to do 1 it doesnt seem to be able to set a reminder for a whole list to alert me during any particular day instead i seem to have to set an alarm for each task which means that i would have alarms going off all day that would drive me insane 2 it isnt possible to contact the developer through the app quite bizarre
1,looked at the reviews for a solution but the app dev just blames the phone its never the same phone for causing the app not to work im having the same problems of the alarm for a task not going off not even a notification blaming the phone when you so its not just one device is lazy
1,snoozing and recurrence behave erratically thus alarms often dont happen when they should developer did support separately and only up to a point issues with notifications which are specific to my device
1,use google tasks its much better and free  you have to subscribe 150 a momth to get full use of this  its a basic reminder app had it have been a one of payment of a tenner then id have brought it but i hate it when you have to subscribe especially for something so basic as this they do it so you subscribe and forget about it just greed
1,unresponsive widget did not work at all on my phone
1, you reaching out has not in any way addressed the question i asked ill uninstall thanks anyway   rather disingenuous response when doing a local backup it informs the user that manual backup will be removed in a future version why would i continue using it if i will not be able to to do a local back up my data at some point in the future   i dont use the cloud so this will be useless to me if i cant backup locally
1,2nd edited review the app is worst for reminders since it takes many minutes to fire which simply means the app is worthless now the customer service told me that im using a cheap device when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone bullst customer service as well since they clearly cant take the blame like a real manwoman bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention go fuk urself customer service good luck selling nuds coz u failed it here
1,mr stephen today i setted my daily schedule with remainders on this app but any single remainder didnt rang with alarm it doesnt notified me about my tasks  schedules
1,im better with myself nowadays cheers
1,alarms and notification is not working even after battery optimization being disabledchecked all the settings
1,thr notion of paying a monthly fee for this is laughable i will stick with todoist for a fre more bucks a month
1,confusing and clunky
1,updated and now no longer sends the task again set to daily if you dismiss the notification
1,absolutely useless worked once then never again am now living in amonst my household waste like stig of the dump 
1,unable to restoreapp version mismatch i just download the app and then i make a backup copy then uninstall and restore it back again and that what it says please do fix it and also make some auto backup or auto save features
1,i tried it and didnt like it it wasnt as easy to use and more complicated than needed to be
1,it is given reminders
1,no reminder for tasks
1,sir plzzz ad some more option like upcoming task and done task so that i can see all detail about my upcoming project and history in seprate options obout this and add repeat option until i will not stop or snooz the task some time i m not able to see my mob so if it will repeat automatically after some duration until i am not select any option and yes i know there is option about repeat i am talking abour different one like auto until i will not choose any option
1,unable to share to do list with another account
1,have been paying for premium each month for several months now and now its not syncing across devices and its telling me to upgrade to premuin on both fone and 2nd device when iam paying for premium pathetic canceling subscription and uninstalling
1,very poor application repeating reminder not workinguseless app
1,it doesnt work at all no alarmno notification nothing at all even after going thru all the settings just wonder how your app get its 47 rating
1,update i uninstalled this app it now causes my phone to crash when i rebootwhich is everyday i downloaded this app because the other app i was using wouldnt always notify me also they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll similar to a digital clock to set the due time i tested this app before i started copying all my tasks but i came across a problem when creating a repeat there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month ie the 3rd saturday of the month or the last sunday of the month this is a big issue for me because i have certain things i want to do but its not always on the same date of the month hopefully this can be addedchanged soon
1,dose not work
1,just a list app you cant do anything else unless its on a list
1,too complicated and time consuming to set a task no way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time not worth the time it takes to use it uninstalling
1,when i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesnt remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper
1,why isnt this app getting downloaded there is some issue with the app it had been recommended to me by my buddy but this thing isnt getting installed on my phone
1,why was i charged 149 for this app i was charged 242020
1,monthly payments for a todo app not gonna happen thank you
1,too hard to use
1,lag all the time
1,what should i do if i want more sublists  there is no way  
1,scheduling reminder intervals does not work
1,this app just isnt for me
1,usless
1,can only put 5 tasks before having to pay
1,i just removed this app i missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me
1,subscription only no outright purchase too bad seems like a nice app
1,used it until simple backup was premiumized restore wont work between different versions unless you modihack the file author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help   restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now will never install this again and i suggest anyone who values his data not to 
1,very pricey
1,has no sign in option only export and the file wont open so unless you have an it friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff i put in tasks has gotten lost if the developer revolves this is i will edit this review
1,the alarm doesnt work
1,definitely i appropriate your hard work and this app different from all those big guys apps but question is if someone lost the phone or uninstalled the app what is the purpose this app so im just suggesting  you can limit the how many task can be added by users without premium opt in ads for auto backup
1,i deleted a list but i still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list even after restarting my phone
1,dont work the best it got was the vibration notification worked i cant get any sound at all from this app
1,i removed this paid app i missed about a dozen events over the few months i owned this i would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up and it showed that it had missed im trying out simple calendar which testing seems to work better
1,need to make more convinient i just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work
1,i cant even get on thing on the opening page much less start a list
1,a simple app that could not be more complicated to operate
1,no hourly reminder
1,this app is not the best
1,  impossible to delete list or sub lists tabs  regret v20 upgrade 
1,absolutely terrible most unless app i have downloaded to date
1,always missing the notifications even when it is not optimized and restricted in background
1,no good
1,only get about half of the reminders
1,awful hard to start impossible to figure out
1,would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications but not only is that a problem but importing from a previous version of tasks is impossible too nevermind ill just stick to what i got
1,edit im using this application many year since release and im loved it and donate now you make this application subscription 15 a year really not happy with that
1,i do not like the functionality of the app i found it is very easy to delete a sub list but if you create a second list i could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings i also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list other people may be okay with these nuances but for me its not i only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it
1,recurrent tasks dont work
1,not good wasted time
1,cant rely for reminders no alarm comes even if i select alarm because of relying on this app i missed an important task
1,there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like micr_oso_fts to do and many other why people think this app easy its not i donated on this app and wasted
1,over complicated
1,extremely unintuitive
1,garbage the one time i cant remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not there was no way to go and see which days i checked it or not whats the point of that
1,dear developers thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app it was not pleasant at all believe me
1,loved for a while one fine day my subtasks got deleted it was in a task for which i didnt set any due date bad experience
1,dont use this unless you sync your tasks the backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad
1,iths just too complicate to use for me
1,pangit
1,was really enjoying this  then the notifications just stopped which is a big part of what i needed the app for annoying finding a new app for this now
1,terrible app
1,worst apk reminder not work
1,doesnt sync to calendar
1,well its broken now i havent messed with any settings in or out of the app and now theres no alarm it just vibrates i checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder why do these reminder apps always break
1,used to work ok now something is skrewy now if i restart my phone every single task comes up as a notification never mind of when the tasks wereare due and the schedule i set now after i dismiss tasks they pop up again ignoring its schedule also wish app could remember which day the task is for if you have a daily task that you complete after midnight it thinks you completed it early and wont remind you later that day finally wish app opened to an overview of all lists
1,nice good
1,how can one trust an app that is supposed 2 help organize when u misspell organize
1,doesnt allow you to do a samsung back up and restore
1,doesnt have a builtin backup and even after exporting a backup file  an error shows up additionally the support email is an invalid email address a total waist of time for setting it
1,i dont want to name everything
1,it was great until it disappeared very unhappy that i lost the app and all my info
1,it doesnt ring the alarm at the right time only when i open my phone it starts ringing useless for me because i want it to ring at the right time and remind me on my realme phone highly disappointed 
1,i dont get a notification or any alarm after i set the due date reminder at all ive already tried a couple of times how do i fix this my settings also allow notifications for the app also how do i set widget on home screen thanks
1,it doesnt do any thing its gliched everytime i open it
1,i wanted a to do list this is not such continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated  kiss
1,too complicated trying to add items to a list it keeps trying to use the item names instead to make a new list or send the old list to this
1,when you try to write a task and you want to set the reminder at the same time you have to make a reminder for each one and its wasting my time if i could i would rate this app 0 stars
1,when i share a list with someone over messenger or sms just the name of the list is shared not the actual list with an ability to collaborate
1,swipe to delete is terrible takes almost 5 swipes so work rendering the app useless
1,after few months it started not checking the task i mean i check and few hours later it is unchecked it should be cleared and the next date for the same task should be displayed example task 1 to date 01jan2019 and repeat task 1 to date 01feb2019 after checking the task for january the task for february should be displayed but after some time the task for january is unchecked
1,my mobile is getting switched off after installingit worked fine on 1st day of installing please fix it
1,too much setup i just want to write my notes not title  subtitle everything on the plus side no permissions
1,i consider it as not easy to use
1,useless so confusing to use cant set simple reminders
1,reminders are not showing notifications for the past 1 week to me sir  
1,thought this was a great app until i realized it doesnt get rid of the checked daily tasks to remind you of the new daily tasks and that is exactly what i was using this for daily tasks i need done when i check remove checked tasks it does nothing and those checked tasks just stay there 
1,terrible im not getting the pre alerts i set or the reminders themselves i go in to check on upcoming reminders  see outdated ones in red that never alerted me
1,i use it for awhile then deleted  it is take more time to use than other note apps confusing and have no reason to keep it  many better note apps out there 
1,ive tried this app 2 times its great but everytime i use it it installs pop up adds all over my phone as soon as i go to open one app their is an addnot cool i deleted it for the 3 and final time
1,alarms and notifications dont work which is crucial to an organiser
1,looked good but wasnt after installing tasks my keyboard stopped appearing for all my apps it was only when i removed tasks as a last resort that the keyboard appeared again
1,needlessly compicated for a to do list app try to add a new item to your list and youll accidentally add a new list try to swipe to switch between lists and youll remove an item from your list what did you just remove hard to say cant seem to find an undo option among the numerous other options
1,app is awesome but in this no login facility and assign task
1,i settled an alarm on this app but it never popped up this looks like a great app but please fix this all my notifications in this app is open
1,this app will not update nor uninstall properly fix it and ill try it again
1,at the beginning was good but i wait two months later and the app keep putting back as not done reminders that i mark as done already and the other task that have date and mark as priority dont even showed me if you can fix that ill stay with the app otherwise i will keep looking sadly the only remid app that work good was the apple one but i dont have iphone anymore so came on please make this one work
1,unable to manage easily complicated
1,date no time
1,it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks guess there is bug who cant handle long task list not recommending
1,notifications only come up when you come app
1,i set a reminder to do a task daily at a certain time however this app does not retain the same time on the daily reminders it will remind you and set the task to do but at an earlier time
1,tried making a simple to do list was gone when i went back later
1,app is very buggy completed tasks keep showing up as not completed notification alarm wont work uninstalling
1,i am not able to set the time  it is automatically taking the remainder timing
1,no instructions i cant even get started because there are no instructions i put in list title groceries and thats it when i try to make a list it asks for sub titles wont let me even start a list just sends ya in circles delete delete
1,hard to set up
1,after a week my tasks never showed up completely stopped working 
1,do not have the account sync feature how we backup data when we change device 
1,doesnt even have a repeat feature
1,its takes a lot of space
1,its too difficult to understand
1,downloaded the ap created a title for the list but then there wasnt any option of anything the list disappeared and there were no instructions or help features to actually create the list items the title vanished anx the s reen was lanmcouldnt then find the list anywhereno list no title nothing stupid
1,horrible it wouldnt even let me make a note
2,the notificafions are not working
2,cant make backups for task lists  this feature is paid we have to buy subscription plan  donate atleast 100 for it 
2,it failed to notify me for the first time i set up recurring monthly notifications for my bills and it was working perfectly im two days late for a bill payment now
2,needs to be more user friendly  looked for a set reminder but could not find one  too many options for me 
2,horrible set up
2,thank u but what i actually want to know is what settings i must use to let the app pop up on the screen even if the screen is locked thanks
2,confusing i want to like this app but as an aspie im finding it confusing to navigate considering deleting 
2,simple app with a fancy design i like it in general but what drives me nuts is a huge lagging when my mobile network and location service are switched on without it the app works almost smoothly i dont know what data do you guys always gather from my phone but i would appreciate some optimization on that
2,paid for premium settings had reflected that i am using paid version up until the most recent update now it says upgrade to premium what is going on
2,the backup feature does not work i am stuck having to copy over 1000 items in my lists manually i understand syncing is a premium feature but the backup feature is not and i wish i hadnt bothered with this app in the first place edit in response to your comment my problem isnt the fact that i want premium features for free it is the fact that i downloaded this app knowing that it had a free backup feature builtin which is the main reason i chose this app your response shows a lack of professionalism and frankly maturity the premium features do not include a backup feature but rather a syncing feature which doesnt suit my needs your app is not the value of a free coffee the premium features cost 2099 for a subscription not a onetime fee the app accepts donations but its also for profit the description of the app and its features are misleading and this is why i am giving you a negative review
2,cyumbersome
2,its not that good as much as i thought before i downloaded it it never sent me notifications or alarms i missed my two events because of this 
2,nice app for remainders
2,the app no longer reminds me of tasks and keeps bringing up ones marked complete
2,thanks but it now has gone wrong being unable to alert and no alarm at all please advise if this app is still ok to keep
2,this app sometimes missed important tasks and didnt notify
2,not at all use  its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app its only alarming while we open the app not usefull at all
2,widget unresponsive boy i am incredibly unlikely i am the only one to ever experience this it must just be me
2,there is no way to create repeated scheduled tasks i already have google calendar for what this does its nicer looking but i dont need what i already have edit in response no its not easy and honestly the app has so many more issues deleting things is difficult but making mistakes in organization is easy organization is not great on this app i dont like your app guys i dont know who its good for but its not me but i appreciate the slight on my post
2,terrible ive missed so many reminders despite adding it to unmonitored apps and not being on power saver i give up
2,mlm
2,my alarm isnt ringing please help everything else is fine
2,loses task lists on premium  dont upgrade so annoyed loved and recommended this app til i upgraded 2 weeks ago got a new phone  realised tasks werent backed up to my gmail account annoying copying the lists over wasnt easy either annoying paid for the upgrade have now lost 3 of my listsvanished from menu no reason not deleted and not in deleted items cant find out how to sign out or cancel premium account use the basic option and dont change your phone
2,go
2,good idea for an app but i uninstalled due to overcomplicated interface for example there are 2  symbols neither of which are selfexplanatory is it for a sub list of main list or another sub list category id prefer there to be words there to explain what they mean and additionally a description of what list youre working under after you enter a list i need an app thats unobtrusive but yet daily i can easily view my to do lists and subgoals
2,i like the apple task app way better
2,the star rating  my comment are only for the move capability the order within the list cant be easily rearranged move to top and move to bottom is the only option theres another move which tries to move the task to the same list if you have only one list what is needed is a simple drag and drop of a task to a different order the 2nd option is to have only move upon touch and hold and then pop up a sub menu this sub menu can have up  down arrow and other move choices
2,its just okay its too easy to delete tasks on accident and it puts it in backwards
2,feel like can add calender
2,the 1st action the app wants is to name a list what am i listing and why would i name it what im looking for is a reminder with an alarm using the ringtones already on my phone to remind me of important events this app doesnt seem to function that way i dont know what id use this app for
2,reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient
2,i loved this app at first but now when i change my task datestimes it doesnt actually change them and continues to alert me at the original time even though ive clearly changed it its very annoying
2,no subscription tank you please full price i no lack forever
2,while swiping towards right the tasks are getting deleted at least it should ask for confirmation whether the delete is happening accidentally or we really want to delete
2,your condescending attitude is not helping yor case there is a sublist reorder but nothing for the main list there is no sort of any kind says sort by do date or lets you pick what to sort by a logic choice completed tasks need to change imiediately so you know its completed  next month is set i didnt say it wasnt simple the interface is not very intuitive i did look at help  there is little for the main list you are very irritating so i am going to try other choices
2,almost what i need except theres no option to set a start  end time with reminder for the start so its useless for me
2,not able to install on more than two devices i found this frustrating as i had one phone stolen and another broke now i cant download on my new phone because its already on the other with my main email does not allow another email not too pleased about this
2,i really want to love this app but it wont even let me select pm so its constantly telling me its past the due date which makes the app very useless to me
2,dont this app have repeat task feature
2,i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization but i set alarms and keep in mind i have all permissions on and it didnt go on my screen so i missed a very important meeting
2,while changing list by scrolling right to left task get deleted its very confusing
2,keeps me on top of things
2,not sure why everyones given this such high reviews the reminders dont work for me which makes the whole point of having this app useless
2,would like to assign priority rating to each task ado it soon bdo it later clow priority ztake it off the list
2,app is unable to manage recurring tasks app has almost everything but it fails on managing recurring task after setting the task to be of repeat type marking task completed for a specific day is marking entire task as completed and for this only reason i had to uninstall please make necessary changes and inform
2,too complicated to save and add
2,had high hopes for this because it had everything i wanted but the completed tasks that i keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating have tried all the settings to get of it but i cant and cant be bothered to persevere anymore
2,why would tasks be tabs instead of a list the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs o
2,i actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders i set reminds for monthly bills such as rent and set it to repeat monthly but when i complete the task it uncompletes itself the very next day without setting the reminder to the next month basically if i set it to november 1st it tries to remind me again daily on november 1st it doesnt work i love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly
2,cancel means stop the actionnot throw away all the notes i just madesorry but this was suppse to save time not waste ideas and planningpoor comms from app on a normalized ui function first go and really turned me off could be lots more awesome but things like this and not being able to recover the info quickly thennot acceptable when doing business tasks nowadays
2,switching from one list to another stinks otherwise helpful
2,useless no nesting
2,not working on xperia e1
2,i dont understand why its not letting me type in it it gets hanged everytime i meant that amake ora onek birokto kortesesorry i speak only bahamian
2,it was okay but when i tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show that is extremely inconvenient and annoying  i tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didnt work would have given five stars if it wasnt for this issue
2,tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks if you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it it will never work again
2,decent app but does not seem to be able to sync with my google calendar without that it is pretty useless to me i like that subtasks are listed as an indent to the main task not as a seperate task
2,i keep completing tasks and the next day they open automatically again and the notification pops up its very irritating and confusing whats the point of opening a completed task maybe you need to add an option to permanently close repeat tasks vs close them for that day
2,please make a home screen where it shows your active main tasks allowing you to just press and view them without having to click the top left button snd select this would be very convenient thank you
2,trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesnt work or give any assistance to troubleshoot i just get the message file not found with nothing else to say where its looking for the file so i can get it in the right place
2,i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen deleting this app for this reason too bad the rest is great but they need a home screen they dont have one
2,app maybe okay but its very confusing to understand i have tried about 30 min to set a simple task for a particular date but it doesnt show up anywhere so i will keep looking for a more simplyfied app sorry
2,wish i could sync it across multiple devices 
2,i love nearly everything about this app but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background
2,recurence tasks does not work properly otherwise i would give 4 starts
2,stupid auto correct
2,cant complete subtasks through widget  huge turn off
2,using this apps i can guarantee you will never remember one single task needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category
2,skips reminders until i pick up and check my phone then they go off
2,le partage est tres nul cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre
2,it is not very flexible its a pain to make sub lists and quickly edit them i wish when the app opened you see a list of all of your major tasks or a calendar if these things are possible maybe adding a tutorial feature when the app first downloads and opens would help streamline the experience
2,i found the white text against many of the colors very difficult to read
2,id like to know how to create home screen widgets
2,not competent at scheduling recurring tasks are automatically completed if not checked by the scheduled time there is no way to know if you missed it the interface is pleasant though
2,i uninstalled the app because it sends my phone info to the developer
2,just started using it but so far so good
2,simple app widget is bad left side has a bar that ruins symmetry also you cant remove the new task button also why can i change list color but cant change button color would also be cool to preview what compactcozy and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one leave settings and go back in to change them again all in all its almost a 5 star app but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit
2,awesome app the only missing thing is that you can only set a date i would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day or on the next day or next week update no what i meant is that i want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time update i would then receive the notification at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings and also i dont want to put in a date look at the app ticktick has exactly what i want 
2,so far the app is great would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch
2,it was pretty good on my old phone then when everything was ported to my new one the app came but not the lists id made whats the point of that ive deleted it
2,bad experience as the events created ex birthdays anniversaries etc in alarm mode is working only sometimes in such situations the event is just turning red but alarm is not ringing as if i missed the event
2,does not have a recurring task feature useless for me
2,you should have name to change date with yesterday today tomorrow not number on widget view
2,cant put cute stickers on them no cuteness on phone
2,to do list apps like this one are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks too bad because the interface is otherwise well done
2,got it primarily for reminders it has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications but those are pretty useless when they dont work didnt get a single notification to remind me of the stuff i set up
2,no easy way to importexport tasks in a compatible format eg google tasks
2,liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks thats a deal breaker for me im uninstalling
2,28 oct 2018 same problem repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date 27 oct 2018 after hearing back from the author giving it another shot put two repeating tasks on it see how it goes 27 oct 2018 this app didnt work as well for me it would regularly uncheck tasks id completed or check tasks id not completed the repeating task function didnt work well either
2,looking as everyone elses very ve reviews i seem to be the odd one out but i didnt find it straightforward it is too easy to delete a list on my s9 at least with even a slight bit of a swipe once deleted it is lost why not have a back or undo button personally i dont find the heading group list structure particularly straightforward although ive now got used to it
2,seriously how did it get a 48 i cant even find an add button anywhere unless i go to the top left corner nah not for me
2,without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one ive seen that doesnt sync anywhere between devices
2,i had a reminder set with a certain sound  it never went off
2,due date is wonky i made a few items on my list and the due will not change from the current day the due date worked on other items i dont need another app to work around
2,it worked for the first week now i cant add a task without it crashing
2,in this app reminder doesnt work
2,it doesnt ring to notify me
2,no google tasks integration
2,"repeat function does not work making the app useless as a task list might 
as well use my calendar almost missed a credit card payment because this 
app didnt repeat the task"
2,"repeat function doesnt work so you cant set up tasks to be repeated 
daily you can basically create a list and then delete items as they are 
completed that is all this does basically useless for anything other than 
a shopping list"
2,no custom repeat frequency
2,"dates and times no such thing here sure you can colorcode and organize and 
sort your tasks to death but strangely enough theres no changing when a 
reminder will go off no setting when a task is due perhaps if you used 
this for work or a meeting or not even the ability to set a due date for 
a task it can be put in the details but when time is of the essence 
youre better off using a better task app"
2,"it sounded good so i installed it my first task is an annual subscription 
reminder this app doesnt offer an annual reminder so yet again id have 
to use two different apps for tasks why cant anyone get this right"
2,does this app truly have reminders it refused to remind me of my event
2,"was excited for this app but the fact i cant change the notification 
alarm is a deal breaker"
2,please make it available as a widget
2,this was ok for a few days but now  when i open it it is just a blank screen and i have lost all my  tasks very annoying as these were important reminders 
3,how do you change the alarm sound on the app it plays my wakeup sound and i hate it i dont want to hear that all the time
3,goodneed improv
3,helpful to stay on track
3,the alarm sometimes goes off without showing any notification
3,most of the times it worked well but sometimes the alarm goes off a few minutes late
3,bagus tapi di aku kayak sana aja sama google keep yang ada di hp
3,good i hope it has fiture for auto daily task and there is report so in end of the week we can see the progress
3,was using just reminder app before this wherein if i had kept my phone on a silent mode then the reminder would only vibrate with notification on screen instead of the alarm tone
3,satisfactory
3,not working fully i was wondering what happened to the reminder i set it only notified me of an event already passed when i opened the app what use is that edit dev telling me im ignoring faq i cant find that when looking at the app on the play store
3,coolbut doesnt give you a reminder
3,kinda throws everything together some apps separates the days weeks and upcomings after 1 day of use there are 2 identical list that shows up and cant figure out how to get rid of one not very user friendly
3,i wish there was a way to save what is in it to be backed up to email
3,i have been trying to get notification but the app doesnt send reminder notification if i keep the app opened it sends but when i close it it doesnt send any notification i have also removed the app from power saving but still nothing can you help
3,hello since last one year i am using this app it is good nice but it has a issue on my mobile i doesnt remainder me when i have set a reminder on a particular date and time it just shows read many times i missed many works plz i hope u will fix it
3,discover for yaw self homie x mas
3,great app no ads no pro features unfortunately latest releases are heavier a slower it takes few seconds to switch from portrait to landscape and viceversa same orientation switch in firefox that is a far more complex operation due to web page redraw is almost instantaneous
3,the alarm of reminders did not ring if the application is not opened then i removed the app from battery optimization list now it works
3,nice app but reminder issue vibrates only  bell doesnt ring
3,works perfectly it is easy to use 1010
3,for the specificities it help me to order what i have to do so great thank
3,i dont know why it missed some alarm ui design is great but i missed some imp task cause of this missed alarm prob
3,everything is okay but it doesnt notify on time i missed an important event because of this bug ive used other apps on play store and all of them have the same problem some of them dont notify when the screen is locked none of them are perfect at times the app notifies me only after i open it
3,why google sync is not available
3,i loved this app before but now for some reason notifications do not pop up and im missing out on really important reminders
3,is there not a way to open it on a desktop please add that feature update other apps offer the same feature without making you upgrade to premium  i rather see more ads than have to pay for that simple feature
3,in free version no backup option
3,alarm doesnt work fine
3,still figuring it out but yea its been helpful and im glad i can cross off what has been done
3,ill learn more
3,widget is not working properly with nova launcher every time you have to open the app to add new task after clossing the app by recent apps
3,not sure if it offers the option to have a list displayed on your home page which is what i am looking for
3,very help has helped to break my task into several categories that has enables me to be more organized
3,was good for years until it suddenly stopped working  all my tasks gone update didnt fix it uninstall
3,pretty good reminder app the recurring reminders dont seem to work very well though ill get a reminder for the first occurrence and then nothing for any of the following events there doesnt appear to be a way to acknowledge the original alarm without deleting it or marking the entire series as complete
3,i love how simple the app is i do wish it was more customizable the background is just plain white id like to add my own wallpaper to the background
3,visually appealing
3,i dont rent apps i will pay a price to use it but walmart doesnt charge by the month or year for pants yes i would prefer ads
3,i didnt have high expectations when i downloaded the app especially based on this lame app icon sorry but its true i really liked the functionality i hope there will be more customization in terms of fonts background colors text colors category colors categories shown as a vertical or horizontal lists or general view  the app would be amazing also i would be willing to pay for this app when its more customizable but only a flat rate im sick of subscriptions the feel so forced
3,this app is overall satisfying however recently i am facing a problemthe alarm wont ring though its scheduledi would kindly appreciate if you would please look into the matter
3,1 struggling to find where to change the alarm tone both system and app config been modified yet the same strange tone remained 2 anywhere to change preferred language thanks steve thats exactly what i did changed every tonesound related item in the app setting as i said it did not work probably it works for others or its the oppo reno mobile issue
3,this app is really good for its format styles compared to other apps but im not getting the alarm reminders which i keep  why is it so
3,i have been researching for a while a new todo list that would replace my wunderlist i finally thought i found one this felt perfect it was userfriendly colorful allowed for notifications reminders etc my biggest problem is that i cant share my lists with my hubby i mainly use this for personal use so i can totally understand that it would only allow for a certain  of people to share with but unfortunately no sharing at all i am back on the hunt  
3,needs to be able to add pictures
3,task formation format is goodbut the alarm doesnt work at allkindly guide mei have tried a lot but nothing happened with alarm
3,im find this app useful but im trying to use it on my desktop currently it is not possible i will adjust this rating once i can
3,simple to do list its ok but you cant even edit tasks after you add them
3,good app overall 2 questions 1st  is it possible to change the checkoff color to anything else then yellow why would it not be green by default 2nd  why is it not possible to check off the subtasks within the widget
3,1 since last update going from one sub list to another has become jumpy it seems to get stuck for a second half way through 2 when new tasks are added to a sub list they dont get the 6 dots on the right unless i sort 3 cannot select more than one task to delete in one motion yes know i can swipe them but that has proven not practical for me call me errorprone if you must 4 there is no feedback function i imagine there is one hidden somewhere why
3,quite good app but recurring tasks which is a basic function doesnt work correctly thus making the app useless even though i impremented all the instructions for huawei still issue is there
3,i just switched from wunderlist why cant i share my list with my family to add or delete from
3,overall its a very good app does the job great user interface however facing issues sometimes when tasks marked completed on widgets are again showed as pending
3,keeps organized but there shouldnt be subs when making a new task
3,i want to be able to set so that the week starts from sunday highly inconvenient for i frequently set the reminder wrongly a day behind please upgrade so that the week start from sunday
3,good would like for completed tasks to automatically move to the bottom
3,why do not work reminders repeated monthly at all onetime yes repeated no what is wrong
3,this is by far the best and complete todo list app i have come across so far however the notification and alarm feature doesnt work would have gotten a 5 star from me if that had worked thank you
3,app is good have lot of features but i would suggest one basic thing that needs to be changed in tasks app the menu can be reached by pressing the title icon also to change the list we have to press the icon on top left corner of widget it is different and little disturbing from normal process we are following since many years please try to change the menu button on widget to the top left icon thanks
3,good but repeat mode is not working properly i am looking for some other app
3,its got a steep learning curve and i dont think its got good documentation  help faqs
3,is it true that nonpremium version soon will loose any way for backuprestore or transfer to another phone if not true please point to me what is the backuprestore way that stays in app in the future thanks a lot if true that is really bad news  backup is a basic necessity so nonpremium version will become practically useless on the long term in addition premium costs twice as much for a single year than lets say osmand for eternity and that is a much more complex app  the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits tasks is a really nice app except that swichingt between sublistslists is unreasonably slow with some unique and essential features but this wracks it it will drive me away possibly others too not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that response to steven nottages response that is fair enough except for one important detail all the people using your free app are now forced to decide  if they want to have a meaningful app  to pay or search for another app premium app should only add features and not restrict free apps capabilities if you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing people will buy it lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay i payed for a number of apps all cheaper than yours btw and actually my plan was to paydonate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear because i thought the app is really useful and it deserves support this change is different i do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc just that you should not remove the free local backup or any other feature or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start best wishes response to steven nottages second response actually you can clearly see from my review that i do not want everything for free my problem is different if we could not understand each other so far perhaps its not worth trying any more so i wont comment on the rest of your answer all the best
3,it was fine until i found that to use features like syncing or transferring lists from an older app i had to upgrade to and pay for premium felt like bait and switch
3,needs a lot more sophistication
3,havent used it a lot yet but enjoying the simple way to add tasks
3,suddenly stopped giving audio reminders tried everything including reinstalling and turning on all notifications uninstalled
3,more hierarchy on task options
3,how soon until the list sharing is available if soon you have just earned a small business customer
3,edited review
3,it was ok
3,got it for he to know do of do not do me to my do do an do gone by hi do you do of do is well your name is on the list for the next few days and i will be there at the same time i dont have a whole lot of time to get the kids to the gum wall street journal and send it to you when i get home i will send you the link to the video of the puzzle in my room you have for me to get the kids to the gum wall street journal and send it to you when i get home i will send you the link to the video of 
3,this app would do better with a calculator tat adds subtracts shopping list columns withtotals also tabsswipes for deleteretrieveupdate21620 1you cant editactual itemon a listlike change its name 2and you cant seeor do a running sub total add or subtract price totalswhat good is a list tat when u put the price of a item your task list cant be more helpful when creating a cost grocery list or whateverlikehardware storeitems list so i deleted
3,very nice app but there are a few bugs with the widget not really updating to the correct data eg  if you put the widget on home screen change the name of the tasks list it doesnt update
3,i really like it but theres one or two things that need to be addit i personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know theres other apps for this but love the check list style but i dont like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is option for never delete plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name
3,absolutely love this app and have been using it for months different lists in different screens via the widget unfortunately the widgets have become unresponsive and now im looking for a new app will this be fixed  using huawei p20 pro mate for reference edit i have reinstalled the app taken the app off battery saver mode when i reinstalled it is still the same clicking on the widget does nothing cant add tasks at all
3,tasks helps me stay organized but i still want some option to be in it like if i want to copy a task from a list to another i should duplicate it in the the same list and then move it to the other list  i wish if i can directly duplicate it but not in the same list  instead in another list directly but in general tasks is a very helpful app for organizing our life
3,useful easy to use and fulfil my needs but i still didnt experience its use in sharing or groups
3,its a good app but i wish it would allow multiple users to see each others task list and to send task to each other
3,i loooove this app but i have a note 10  it was destroying my battery i had to uninstall it
3,i do have a few problems but the app is fairly easy and i can keep up with everything quite well
3,ive only had this app for about a week but so far so good no ads as yet very easy to use
3,i wish it had a widget but i love it otherwise
3,minimum 3 stars no real problems so far nothing to compare it to but its bright and keeping me organized
3,i was hoping for similar to notes app on iphone not even close but i prob dont know how to use it
3,it is good to organise the tasks the only problem isi am not able to get reminders i am setting the reminder but it is but showing
3,i actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget if i make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget
3,seems good so far i might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say i didnt like it or rate it now edit to reply to the response there was only the option to review now or say i didnt like it i would have picked review later if that was there edit 2 thanks for taking my suggestion on board i will update this review and rating once i have used the app more 
3,those dots on the right of each item are gone how do you reorder your to do items now
3,i just started using it so im not sure how good it is yet i do really wish you could do bullet points like    that you could check off it would be much easier in some cases than a separate sub list  that is currently what i need 
3,just started hence neutral stars i was going to write to the devs but i see you reply here open is good i dont know what a filtered list is that is my only confusion so far i was interested in premium but put off by the monthly fee rather than a single license meanwhile i was playing with the idea of selling each premium feature separately that would give you information about what your users want  especially after you add computer support feed the wolf you want linux 1st
3,good but still does not handle repeat events such as daylight savings time change ie setting a reminder for the second sunday of march each year to change clocks that dont adjust automatically does not handle last day of the month reminders well also the list should display an icon by repeating tasks backup options are very limited does not handle integration with eg dropbox otherwise it would be perfect for my needs
3,rather new to the app to rate it higher than a 3 at this time but i like the results it is helping me to achieve i expect improved time management as i get the apps feature set up to serve me best i sense i may rate it higher as i experience it benefits more i do like using it better then wunderlist
3,gets a on the phone list of things to do done
3,really pretty good app but two problems 1 sometimes repeat weekly reminders dont work at all especially if you havent ticked it the previous week 2 please allow multiple reminders for one event thanks its really promising and useful otherwise
3,used it twice so far so good
3,it doesnt reset or set you reminders but it helps
3,amazing and helpful
3,it it good but i couldnt do simple lists they would be in one big catagory then in a sub list and it just wasnt the format i wanted
3,does it not have feature to set reminder daily weekly monthly and yearly
3,as i am a regular user of this appthis app needs some update like the calendar based listing method people will go to date and list the taskanother problem is so many color for list its annoying who dont like colors they can select one color for every task list that is all
3,i liked a lot about this app but unfortunately there is no feature to repeat tasks hourly daily weekly etc which is kinda vital for me without it i cant recommend this app much as i hate todoists subscription model they seem to be the leader as of right now
3,unable to download
3,its not a bad app at all but it could be better if you could keep track of how often you complete a task that would be better like if you checked off every time you shampooed your hair it would be nice to keep track so you can change how much you shampoo if needed also i feel like having a bar at the top to switch between lists makes more sense than the way it is now you should still give it a try if you need something like this because you might like it better than i did
3,i used to love this app but since my phone updated it no longer works i recently uninstalled and re installed i hope it works or ill have to find something new 
3,very good app but something lacl there is options default task set today tommorow etc one more problem when we add task in any list it automatically saved in other other when we add task any date it demand time necessary it shoud be optinal
3,i love the app but you cannot add file to your task or schedule this lack of ability to add file on such good app make it incomplete i could have rated it 5
3,expecting better need alarm facilty to remind me in advance
3,sufficient for my needs simple to use
3,the app is helpful and has nice features i would give 5 stars but you apparently you are not able to transfer your lists to another device unless you have exactly the same version i had to create all my lists from scratch
3,easy to use and keep my tasks in check love that i can have different sub tasks for different projects though i wish they could vbe color coded so as to differentiate them
3,seems laggy moving between lists and tabs after the latest update no way to delete a parent list without manually deleting all sublists first edit i see the delete option for subtasks but how do you delete sublists and parent lists i understand its a hobby project and i appreciate that just making sure im not missing something
3,looks good but doesnt have web version would be 5 stars if i was rating authors dedication functionality wise cant give more than 3 the app is inferior to anydo or microsofts todo
3,lower rating until i use it more just started
3,i have not been using app for very long therefore the 3 star rating after some use i will return to rate again
3,enjoying the app
3,it was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
3,i just downloaded installed this app i was in search of an app that allows me to insert date and time stamp preferably using a button on the screen this way i can time stamp different sections in my notes and activities however i didnt find that feature would love to see that in this app as it needs quite a few of my requirements
3,this app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do the quick post function is great however unlike other similar apps this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen so for me that is really unfortunate if this changes i will gladly give this a perfect rating
3,nice but am looking for something that can synchronize with google tasks
3,sound now works but when i have the phones do not disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound i have it set to ignore do not disturb and have it set to alarm my other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as task so its not my phone causing no sound issue what else could it be stephen you get it working and you get 4 stars restore still does not work gave up on that
3,good app for task but should be linked with reminders
3,i found this app difficult to use thats just my personal opinion i uninstalled it and got a different one that is easier to use
3,helps me stay organized
3,i personally would like to add to this app if i had a chance is change how the entires were set up you had to make up the name but it would make it better if it had a date and name to me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper add more cool features that you cant find anywhere else
3,how to view the app on laptop just like wunderlist
3,i have to uninstalled this app on my phone soon i open the apps and trying to make things to do list it worked fine just i have trypophobia and those small circlesdot just freaking me out edit the small circlesdots that i mean here is when i click new list next we fill the list name and it appears with small circlesdots in color for me whos having this kind of phobia that kind of design is just scary aside of that your apps seems to be simple and easy to use
3,сильно не хватает возможности поделиться списком например покупок с семей
3,i couldnt find a way to link to google tasks that is my first priority so i have data backup and desktop list edits
3,no white space between tasks no line between tasks checkboxes are in the middle of an item one big block of text instead of neat list of tasks just impossible to see where each task starts
3,its listing the same tasks after some time even after its checked and completed in short its listing the status of tasks
3,great app but tried backing up and restoring for a new phone and got a version mismatch error with no option to convert it no mention of this beforr backing up disappointing
3,nice app but doesnt really have what im looking for
3,sub tasks should be possible to leave unticked  for instance i might have put the bins out but not replaced bin bags on your apo if i tick the main task it assumes i have done the sub task
3,its not easily understood and it does not notify if you are setting a task that the due date or due time is past i might want to set 1600hrm task tomorrow at 1800hrm today it will still set the task and will think i have set a task meanwhile the date is today
3,not for me
3,still testing
3,still exploring the app but so far so good
3,nice app but ux can be improved
4,problem when my samsung galaxy note 10 does a system update upon restart of the phone my tasks with past due alarm settings set for various times other that of the restart start going off one after another strange still super helpful used at easter for tasks to do days before shop for turkey to thaw in time  day of sublists worked great to set up each day separately under the same list suggestion allow sharing my list to within the app of another person who also has this app
4,new to app but so far it is meeting my need
4,as author said check your battery settings to get notifications every time nice app to get notified when required
4,great to be able to set reminders for tasks will recommend
4,simple to use and useful app
4,its amazing but the premium is annoying but i guess its fair due to the fact that the app is free even though you programmed it i am very grateful
4,easy and does what it says a bit of improvement can help but nonetheless a great app
4,excellent app in all waysone thing that i could suggest is that we can add things inbetween instead of the new items always going to the top or bottomother apps have this feature but i would definitely recommend thisit even lets you color code what is important  thank you  great app 
4,great app the subtasks feature really helps me feel ive achieved something when i can tick off a small part of a bigger job
4,beautiful app but not worth paying the subscription their web sync feature only available for premium memebrs is even worse than a free version of todoist
4,easy to use and does the job in an easy user friendly format
4,does almost everything i need i have tasks that occur on the 2nd sunday 3rd thursday etc of each month cant figure out how to set the repeat for that
4,i just down loaded the app and figuring out out so far so good but  when i open the app i would like to see all my lists come up vs having to go to the top corner to pull them up did i miss a how to somewhere where this is possible 
4,i rarely rate apps but this one is awesome i use it all the time for anything if i may give feedback for improvement id say it could use more useful widgets such as a calendar tasks calendar is visible only when opening the app and as i note everything here i would appreciate a widget for me to see everything at a glance without opening the app and i would like to be able to choose a list and its sublist tabs to display as a widget rather than the sublist only keep up working 
4,simple way to keeptrack notes
4,i love this app and i plan to get premium but i am waiting for list sharing i will also update to 5 stars then i just hope that you can share via copypaste as in it generates a list separated by commas andor new lines so i can easily text it that would be fantastic
4,good so far for basic list finding it hard to work out what else it can do
4,great app simple and elegant
4,application is beautiful you can find the most common features of tasks  todo list include repeat task notification  alarm  subtasks real i like it after try more than 4 or 5 apps but i have some improvement wish to take in consideration app design is not reach it can be more awesome or using material design  second integration with online web view or sync with google account to viewedit my tasks from browser may be its paid if that at least open view for tasks for normal users thanks and keep the good progress 
4,very nice and clean love the app
4,quick and easy to use really helps me stay organized
4,its a bit confusing for some people can you make it easier for older people
4,so far exactly what i needed and some i havent used ut to its full potential but so far its more than enough
4,works well no behind hidden pay wall
4,app is good  but it should offer features of grouping items day wise
4,simple and effective and im techchallenged
4,love it but i just wish i could see all my lists at once in the widget
4,i like the app alot but there is one problem when i set the reminder as a alarm it doesnt ring on time and before this app was nice its just that problem and now it doesnt ring on time and i missed a meeting because it rang late but anyway this app is nice
4,the completed task button is hard to tap on phones with curved screen edges because its too far too the outside moving it in a bit would make it perfect
4,amazing app the fact that they provide so much flexibility on using subtasks is beyond my expectations howeverit lacks of personally the most important part of a task app widget dont get me wrong i know theres the option for it but everytime i try to put more than one it kept showing the same task i had a lot of tasks to put on my screen so it was somewhat frustrating that i have to open the app to see the list i hope they can add option to choose the task we want to display thx
4,i wish you could develop a voice reminder otherwise its helpful
4,good program lacking a few options like multiple alerts
4,i love this notes app the one thing missing is being able to attach picture files to a note i would love if that could be added
4,i like this app it so useful
4,keeping me on top of stuff love the colors
4,very good a big step up from the reminders app not perfect some of the wording can bd confusing but still a great app and one that i think will be very useful plus the widget is the best ive seen
4,very helpful once you get used to the menus
4,i like it easy backup and simple clean interface
4,still finding new things i like but i do wish i could add photos to some lists a widget for one list would also be awesome
4,this app is fantastic its simple but extremely deep allowing you to add quick tasks in an instant but also categorize and subcategorize customize prioritize and organize all your tasks in almost any way you want you can set notifications reminders etc i really love the filtered lists eg only high priority tasks due in 7 days or less and subtasks are awesome it would be nice to be able to have individual due dates for subtasks and the recurring tasks process is a wee clunky
4,good for shopping list
4,this is a great app really helps me get those to dos done
4,its a nice good looking app with one downside you can create only 1 level of subtasks
4,enjoying using it still finding my way but all good so far
4,i like it up to now 
4,useful only thing is need to put too many titles 
4,its so easy to use and so convenient to use
4,has advanced features and a simple interface
4,its really easy to understand i use it a lot but somehow i dont get a notification for when a task is due
4,its great but i felt like it need a calender so you can see your to do lists youve made over the year so i suggest makeing a new version that has this on it so it will be much better if it had it i mean thats just my opinion on i but its a great app if you just want to write your to do list and get it all over with and check of the biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg check lists you need to tick of
4,great app but it doesnt remind me or send notifications
4,this is one of my fave tool specially as a student i like things being organized and neat so this app is a really great one 
4,great app still waiting for a multi select option but i know things take time its very similar to wunderlist which i loved hopefully it will make a great replacement
4,useful app for organizing possible to copy lists and move done tasks to other lists tasks can have subtasks
4,it helps me remember
4,very handy to keep track of my grocery lists etc also i can send lists to other apps like messenger
4,great for making my lists
4,nice and simple for my needs
4,excellent app this helps me be productive organise my daily task
4,been brilliant for ages now it crashes freezes constantly looking for an alternative sadly
4,it is the best to do list app i ever used but there is some fault in the reminder  i added a task and set it to repeat daily but the reminder just reminds me on 1st day and then reminder stopped by itself
4,very helpful specially now that we need to keep a tight schedule for school and work
4,its quite a useful app i find it also easy to use
4,so far very easy and intuitive to use
4,good app easy input and navigation
4,excellent resource for busy day
4,very easy to use
4,its exactly what i needed i am satisfied  for 5  rating  it should have a feature with which i can analyse my throughout productivity
4,its really a big pity that the app does not have badge icons otherwise it would be perfect especially the custom recurring date option which is a rarity i give four stars though  as the app is really cool ps badge icons are the little red dots with numbers in them on the top right part of app iconswidgets showing missed calls unread messagesmails upcomingdue tasks etc
4,i really love this app but its not perfect heres my thoughts pros  allows you to make reminders either a push notification or an alarm this is very hard to find in a reminder app  highly flexible and customizable allowing you to set priority add subtasks custom snooze lengths etc cons  not a super clean interface  not always an intuitive interface  the widget often gets behind overall great for someone looking for a very flexible app but not for a minimalist
4,very organised reminder
4,very helpful enjoying it
4,ive been using this for a week now i have found it to be a simple to use yet a valuable tool really recommend this app
4,its a great app giving it 4 star because i would like to see an option of dividing tasks into 2 sections based on completed or not the app currently only has the option of marking as correct and striking through superb free app otherwise
4,i only needed a way to make a to do list that i can check off tasks to do does this it has many other features that i have not looked into or needed to use
4,the reminders are very helpful the notification method works for me
4,so far this app has been helpful and fairly easy to use
4,work exactly as promised
4,love it helps me keep my days on track
4,looks good but no sound why
4,simple to use and pretty effective glad it has no ads and it is easy to make categories and sub catagories
4,it has many features still getting used to it so far so good
4,love this app very helpful
4,after a week of use its almost perfect a couple features arent intuitive but i think ive figured it out i love the widgets editing right from my home screen is so great 45 stars because theres no reoccurring task option and i cant figure out how to hide completed tasks thanks for a really fantastic  option rich app 
4,useful and easy to use
4,nice and simple to use
4,this app is perfect for my needs but there is one issue that i just noticed on repeated tasks once you hit complete the task it will not add automaticly the next task you have to check and then uncheck the task in order to show the next repeated task otherwise if you leave the task checked it will not remind you for the next repeated task
4,simple app that meets my expectations
4,its helpful
4,dev use case it would be nice if you could order your list by multiple options ex order first by date due and then by priority
4,this app is very good you can make a list of any activity which you do and keep yourself updated only concern i can see whenever we entered any task open date should come and when we finish task finish date should come also if we want to delete any task list than app doesnt allow us for do that
4,great app helps in daily task setting and monitoring
4,would be 5 stars if there were a setting to automatically return to home screen when creating a task via the widget
4,so far so goodit works just fine
4,simple user friendly and very effective
4,been great
4,it ticks what i need
4,i love this app i love the option for different colors for tasks i originally got it because it was the only app that allowed me to do what i wanted to do for making grocery lists but now i use it for every the only feature i feel is missing right now is the option to add files to a task or subtask
4,simple reliable and syncing with google calendar love it so much
4,it is very useful in grocery shopping and for a daily routine i recommend you getting it especially if you are a busy person
4,good organizational app could use more tutorial guidance but most things can be figured out would recommend
4,works good i wish i could voice command to add a note
4,the app is super easy to use and the due date function is a great help to not procrastinate
4,really useful app it does the job well i like the customisation of colours and stuff i wish there was a homepage where you can see all your lists like a bulletin board and more aesthetic customisation would be nice without making it too cluttered ofc just my 2 cents opinion
4,best one i ve used to date
4,with adhd ive been having a hard time organizing my time and this helps considerably thank you
4,great app for writing down things you need to do and stay organized love how i can put the widget on the home screen and use it from there also like how i can color code each list and shows when they were created and completed good thinking dont think i can back up my infotasks to save for later but its a pretty great useful app
4,this app is so useful for me during lockdown covid19 as iam able to complete my school work and also other impt task so thanks a lot but i suggest you to please make sure that time which is given us  is for both startstop the work so that one can know his or her time allocation for the work  although this app is literally so nice 
4,after you figure out how to best organize yourself its extremely satisfying to check off items from your lists the only thing i do not like us that you cant simply delete lists
4,nice user experience would be helpful if able to sync with gmail account
4,great  easy to use on n samsung galaxy note
4,pretty good app will recommend over others
4,its a good application to keep you on track
4,thanks for your quick correspondence i understand how the applications progress is limited due to resources and hope that this will improve for all involved with time i know times are tough for many worldwide which means funding now more than before is harder to come by all the best cheers
4,so far so good app is really fun to use and easy to add tasks on the fly
4,great app but there is still for improvment until reaches the standards of the beloved wunderlist edit as answer there is nothing wrong with the app but once one could use wunderlist well that is a 5 stars hard to reach it the most important thing is well out of reach for a personal project the web interface and the multiplatform concept certainly other details but as you know wunderlist is deceased so i cant go back and make a side by side comparison note that i dont do the silly thing of rate what i dont like with 1 and what i like with 5 between 1 and 5 there is the 23 and 4 and they should be used a four is a very good rate a 5 is for something which is truly unbeatable unique the best
4,good way for organizing tasks
4,very easy to use once you understand the difference between the list name and the actual task name you place various tasks into whatever lists you create
4,good for a shopping list
4,if you like a simple app to get the job donethis is it
4,i could not find a save button i had problem adding a task then adding a sub task one this was sorted i have managed to have tasks and sub tasks would like to be able to sort list alphabetically
4,i could use this application to categorize my short and long terms goals i appreciate that thanks
4,everything is good but sometimes i dont get notifications the other lists do but one doesnt
4,great app easy to use and very useful my only wish is that it interacted with google assistant so that i could add tasks with voice i drive alot and i tend to think of things to add
4,works well my big complaint is that for repeated items the date does not update after you mark it completed i have tasks that are meant to be done every 3 days that still say due may 14th even after marking them complete fix this and i will give 5 stars lg v40 thinq
4,really helpful app but it would be great if you guys add lock feature for individual entry and make the backup feature in such a way so that if i uninstall and then install it again i require a pin to unlock the locked entry also if possible add the pin on notification option
4,of all the check list apps ive tried out this one is the best organized and its customizable without being overly complicated
4,when i buy a product on the list and touch the item that i bought i simply wish to see a line through it and it is that deleted item along with all other deleted items that i wish to keep forever so that when time comes again i can touch the deleted item and simply remove the line strikethrough as an item to purchase again so it is the deleted items i wish to keep forever
4,i wish i can use hand writing
4,nice organizational app with lots of lists i do wish it would save a task when you add it to a list rather than when you hit the button to save the whole list ive lost some lists i wrote because i pressed back instead of save by accident in general love the app though
4,helpful and easy to use really good app for students or people who struggle with remembering tasks they have to get done
4,big help as i always have mobile phone with me
4,i like that i can make different lists and sublists of tasks and its easy to move something from one list to another or cross something off the one thing its missing is that if i have a list called today and one called tomorrow it doesnt automatically change where the tasks are like if i have a task on today and dont get to do it id love for it to show up in my tomorrow list tomorrow otherwise its easy to use and i also love that there is a place to put notes for each task item
4,it does what it says rather nicely advanced reminders are nice easy to use
4,very helpful in organizing my life
4,very helpful when it comes to organizing
4,really helps to know when tasks are completed it would be a solid 5 if when you shared say with google drive that the completed dates would transcribe in the transfer major reason for chosing this app was knowing when something was accomplished otherwise a great piece of software very functional in task management
4,this has everything im looking for from a ui perspective except one key thing the ability to invite someone else to addcomplete list items with you its the function wunderlist fulfilled for us and ive been looking for a replacement ever since they were bought by ms add it and it will be the dream list app i want
4,this is a really cool app to plan your day through outsuper colourfulbut i found something badthat is the remainders are not working properly please work on it otherwise it it super cool edit  thanks for your reply siri have tried all the ways to make it work but still it is not working
4,very easy to use good
4,amazing app only wish that when you search it would also look in sub task also would like tags for both task and sub taks
4,so far so good great app
4,easy to handle
4,i think its over all a good app
4,so far so good i like the simple clean layout and i purchased the premium so loving being able to jot down on either device would love a grocery list but ill figure it out as i go
4,it helps me complete the task i wanted to do it also reminds me on what to do if i ever forgot something 
4,good app  if you could add priority input at quick add level it would be wonderful or else  if multitask could be added priority ar 1 go would be good
4,easy to use perfect need to make a to do list
4,simple and very helpful
4,best todo list ive tried so farthink ill keep this one
4,using it for the past week so far its great
4,works perfectly helping heaps to manage my day
4,this application is worth installing it really helps you to remain organised without any stress humble suggestion it would have been more convenient if you had provided 23 reminders possible without mandatory snooze to understand this concept very clearly you are requested to study snplan application all the best
4,really excellent for keeping track of daily routines or one time events far off i would appreciate some options on when daily tasks reset and that the task would reset the next day if i missed it but these are small complaints this has really improved my quality of life
4,i love this app so much this is the app that i search for a long time but the widget sometimes error it show the tasks that already checked being unchecked when i clicked it the app just show white screen or freezing after several minutes it became normal again even though it will be normal again of course thats so annoying when im in rush to create task the freeze often makes me forget about the things that i want to write please fix this thank you
4,so far i love the app it allows you to have multiple lists i like the different colour options for each list the sub task section is useful especially since you can see it under the main task
4,i kinda love this app but the only problem that ive face now is that i want to have my task on my pc and i think it would be great if you could put some accounts so that we can easily sort our task in any devices that we are into
4,hi steve is it possible to add voice reminder notifications in your app using google tts tool
4,i love it but theres one thing you should add a note pad for notes for extra
4,helps me remember things that i need to do
4,how can i change the language
4,this app is so far the best todo list app it has almost everything i want but currently if i complete a subtask it doesnt add up to the main percentage of menu list only shows percentage in absolute value unless i complete all the subtask under a task i really need it to show the percentages like this ie 905 if i am unable to complete some of the sub tasks
4,i really love the app the design and functionality its just that i hope there is a way to better navigate the different tasks they are together on the left menu with the calendar calendar is not even a task
4,not bad pretty basic but its helpful
4,it sucks and it awesome
4,helps stay organized wish it kept track daily
4,helpful with reminding me of things that need to be done
4,ive been using your app for awhile now  love it but for the 1st time today everything i did since last night is not there  i do a lot of personal  work things can you please help me with this problem
4,great and fabulous helps me to manage and organise my tasks
4,so far working great
4,clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions two thumbs unfortunately i cant find information about the apps functions even within the help menu  recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete i cant figure out how to make them reset even if they are incomplete  i cant make my recurring items show up on the calendar  i cant manually set the reset time since my tasks might be completed between 8pm and 3 am  view previous recurring tasks
4,really good app
4,very handy tool
4,useful one
4,just started using cant figure out yet how to delete completed tasks instead of moving or crossing them off
4,update developer responded quickly with explanation so impressed that im trying it anyway ___ original review couldnt move onto sd card so didnt have the space to keep it and try it properly
4,having a list of things to buy with items linked to tasks would be great

5,best but smtimes missing my notification please make more reminder option and more hard to rid it
5,just started using the app and i am impressed so far one thing i havent figured out how to do yet is setting a repeating task based on the day of the month ie the first wednesday of the month or the last friday of the month etc updated rating and review i just updated my rating from 4 stars to 5 because of the responsiveness of the developer
5,really enjoying this app love the sublist feature and the ability to move task to another list
5,this app helped me organize myself thank you
5,easy to add and remove tasks i need simple or i wont do it lazy maybe but im being real
5,easy to use and intuitive
5,hvnt bn using very long but so far its been a great app only issue i have is when working on a list if i pause to check something then go back to tasks screen it defaults back to another list instead of the one ive been working on so hv to be careful something doesnt accidently wind up on the wrong list update developer took the time to reply same day with a logical  reasonable explanation
5,useful app to organise tasks
5,i love this app this is very helpful for me especially for my studies it notifies me and it easier for me to take down or type down my assignments or requirements that needs to be accomplish
5,great app easy to use 
5,this is actually a really beautiful well made app blessed to have found it thank you
5,works well easy to manage love the subtask

5,love the widget love how you can easily reorder tasks love how you can check and uncheck things i use this for meal planning time blocking and cleaning tasks
5,nice work
5,love this app so much 3 its helped me out a ton
5,i really like many of the function especially since they are easy to use now if i may say i would like to see a more elaborate calendar set up much like the one used in google calendar where the user can see the whole month at once plus it can be very useful to add an option where tasks are set up where they repeat even if the user has missed a deadline for a previous one im a college student and i like to see what sorts of homework i have done and which ones i have missed
5,has been very useful this past year no longer need to think or stress about a long list of tasks
5,nice listing options
5,i actually never ever write comments or anything about an app but this one is too good i have so many assignments that are due and lots of work and its overwhelming i was searching everywhere for a decent app and this one was the best you can set alarms or notifications for assignments you can title each subject color code everything qnd its just a great app no citiques from meh
5,keeps me organized with my assignments
5,the reminders on my phone quit working i found this and used it as a replacement best reminders app ever it helps me stay really organized i i reccomend it
5,updated after getting feedback from the developer i now see that you can set up repeat tasks you just have to set a due date before the option appears i use this app almost daily and i love the ability to have sub task lists now that i know how to set repeat tasks i anticipate using it even more thank you stephen for reaching out to me and helping me with your app got your fifth star up there now 
5,it is easy to use
5,beautiful app so thankful that its free helps me so much with managing both school and life tasks
5,excellent app for to do lists and reminders either by alarm or notification would love if it also added a banner to the locked phone screen
5,tried several other to do lists but liked this one better helps me to make myself reminders just have to remember to make the lists its hard getting old
5,so glad i found this app i used google keep for years but decided to look for a new app to replace keep bc lists max out at 1000 todo items colors are limited and other probs im very happy with tasks it has way more options than keep tasks handles subtasks better lets you move items from one list to another set recurring tasks and check them off each day add task level due dates records when task were added to list beautiful interface and great functionality
5,everything works exactly as it should it is user friendly and perfect no nonsense and i would totally pay for this if i had to
5,awesome application to manage your tasks youve all required features simple yet effective interface thanks for many such nice and making everyones life easier
5,very useful really like the organization of this app tried others but this works really well
5,easy peasybetter than little notes that get lost love this app
5,i love the fact that this app allows me to create subtasks its been extremely helpful for me i was behind in all of my college classes bit off more than i can chew but this app really helped me take on the workload stepbystep now two weeks later im back on top of things this app was a huge help
5,i can got all i need in this app good job
5,easy to use and having most functions that i desire just one thing i would suggest for the recurring tasks it would be more useful if i mark completed this time but the app will remark it as an open task when it reaches half of the interval before next due date hope the smart developer can make it works like this way soon good luck 
5,easy like a checklist that is ticked off all i need
5,very useful and easy to use
5,extremely easy works fast can organize alphabetically and many other ways i used another app just before this one and uninstalled it immediately to use this one instead thank you
5,absolutely love this app its the best to do list app ive found and ive tried a lot its just so simple and intuitive i wont be trying any more after this its the one
5,i am 76 years old so when i say this is a flexible expansive yet intuitive app you can believe me
5,fantastic app i was using samsung notes before i discovered this app very well laid out easy to use and with so many good features and options kudos to the developer i dont usually provide feedback on an app due to privacy but with this one i had to let the developer and the public know best in class thanks a million
5,the best app for taskas and very helpful go stay on tracks simple and intutive 5 stars from serbia
5,easy to use and helps me stay on top of tasks
5,really easy to use helps keep all my lists in one place one request please is it possible to choose to hide futuredated tasks until a week before theyre due or at a specified date
1,i used to use this app for years but it does not sync on oneplus 7t android 10 i have to sync on google calendar first to update events on this app
1,somehow just cleared my entire schedule
1,xperia 5 ii newly created tasks in device dont sync to google tasks had the same problem with xperia z3 compact it worked on on s10e
1,any event with repeat will not save new update as of sept 2020 cannot set recurring events and i paid years ago for full version no longer useful
1,i loved using this calender app to keep track of all my appointments until it suddenly deleted them all in the middle of my work day  now im screwed
1,2 bad  not as expected no sound alarm 
1,broke widget on fold 2 widget is stretched and distorted
1,i had this app for less than 5 minutes on my samsung note 9 i also keep widgets that count down the daysall of them are empty so i go to my old calendar after uninstaller this one and most of my calendar events are gone this includes my work schedule and many other eventsi am at my wits end about what to do to get my events backsooo not happy right now
1,they took the ads too far and ruined the entire experience completely useless as a free app
1,i uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for the pro version it was refunded its pro features dont work as hoped especially font and color customization the unpaid version advertised presets aka themes but they did not exist in the pro version this is on an android 10 oxygen 1031 tmus 16t developer your 20201014 reply makes no sense it still doesnt take into account this particular phone or my specific terms im letting you know theres a bug and your reply of 20201019 just means you deliberately confuse the matter with nonsensical questions this has been going on for months its why were not using this app free or paid on any of our phones
1,thieves i paid for the pro version on another google account but i had to delete that account because of a massive influx of spam and harassment every other developer understood my situation and was kind enough to provide me with a promotion code so that i could have full access to the software of theirs i paid for not these jerks i spread the blame equally on google for failing to provide a way to transfer purchases and on these developers for being predatory capitalist pigs
1,this app needs access to everything so of course like a dipshitidiot i gave access next time i went to sign into something else my passwords were flagged and a warning pops up stating that an app or website has compromised your passwords i stupidly bought this app because you cannot customize without buying i should have deleted right then but i still paid now my passwords have been compromised by this app im spending extra time changing passwords to protect my data all because of the
1,ads trial limited and boring i understand of ads appearing after every now and then but what i wanted to use was the 1 day widget on the screen could not even do thatthere are tons of ad free apps that let you do all these uninstalling
1,now down to 1 star for the unappreciated bilingual holiday settings for bc canada absolutely no need for this the phone and app setting where the language is set to english should override any other situation i didnt get a satisfactory answer from the dev ill keep deducting stars as long as the app doesnt improve update july 20 over 543 different apps and the only 1 ramming french down my phone is bc2 my 1 star wont change until you do no change
1,i had the app for long time but lately have started has the longest and most annoying advs that you cant even close your phone without watching them all plenty of other apps so no reason to keep it unistall immediately
1,unfortunately i have to change my mind about this calender i use this app for several years now and the prior version before but now every now and then the app overerrides all future calender entries in my main calender i believe it happens when the app gets an update after the update the app syncs with the calender and overrides the google calender so that all future entries are deleted this is not acceptable has this issue been known to be occurring as for now this app does not work
1,contains too many trackers while being paid use acalendar or even better etar instead
1,keeps removing monthly scheduled events
1,calendar notifications are forwarded to my smartwatch in case of emergency it is unacceptable to have commercials in those notifications such as todays pro 50 off unlock tons of premium features now such notification spam makes me want to switch to a different calendar app quit it
1,now there are ads i have used this app for years and there were no annoying ads now i randomly get a full screen ad with no way to dismiss after saving a new calendar entry bad move a small ad at the bottom of the screen would be ok but a full screen ad that has to play all the way through no thanks will find a new app very disappointed
1,junk app
1,been great for years the ads are really annoying they are long video ones that pop up every single time you add an event laughably the response is its only every 18 hours guess how often casual calendar users use the app i wouldnt mind if it was a short add or i had to watch a video to unlock more actions but the current cx is super annoying
1,ads are obnoxious ive used this app for over 2 years and now whenever i edit a calendar event an ad comes up and takes up my entire screen unfortunately ill be looking for a new app
1,i am upset i switch phones and dont know what happen i dont have anything i wrote in calender there anymore and it was buisness stuff
1,dont pay for pro i paid for the pro changed phones and it removed my pro status and wants me to pay again
1,used to be good but recently it shows full screen ads which cannot be turned off update the length of the adds and impossibility to skip is getting annoying the synchronization is not wat it was
1,too many ads are a deal breaker uninstalling unskippable ads are a deal breaker
1,this app use to be all calendars in one app but not anymore so frustrating that you are not able to add anymore o365exchange calendars not willing to use 2 separate calendar apps sorry
1,uninstalling ad after ad after ad after ad on and on and on and on sick of it tired of it cant even have a simple calender app without all the ads done with it
1,ads are very intrusive
1,ads take over the screen  unable to use phone until the ad runs through cant even exit the app during that period of time have to provide another ads option such as banner ads
1,after using this app for a few years it has suddenly started deleting random appointments its done this before the app cost me over 200 in lost earnings due to missed appointments last week so its getting deleted and im going back to the stock app until i find a better one
1,ive used this app for years and paid for the full pro version out right now it claims i havent bought it and keeps putting ads in one star until i can get this fixed
1,unskippable fullscreen ads in a calendar app that i paid for nice at least this reminded me how much better the default calendar app is anyways
1,widget does not display holidays or birthdays not even the app it self shows holidays i uninstalled and reinstalled several and nothing i have it sync with my samsung calendar and the option to show holidays too i have the paid version without adds oddly enough i only can see 2 holidays in 2021 which are first day of black history month and first day of womens history month no christmas new years memorial day or any other
1,having to link my existing calander with the separate calander defeats the purpose of having a separate work calanderim not trying to have a screen filled with sht i have to spend a ton of time scanning through and dividing between ill buy a paper agenda thanks for the effort though 
1,many seconds of full screen commercials when saving new events earlier versions were much better now i need to use another calendar as this is too annoying
1,ads that completely take over your phone  have a forced timer so you cant exit out of them  edit  its untrue what the developer says regarding ads appearing once every 18 hours it is more frequent the skip the developer is referring to is not instantly available you must wait a timer out  it wouldnt be a problem if the ads werent so disruptive they literally take over your screen i have no problem with small less annoying ads
1,why in the world theres no signin or backup option how am i supposed to store my data this app is so great but not having the very important feature makes no sense im so disappointed
1,i like the options but doesnt sync with my calendars i bought a app called one calendar  that one dies sync well with my calendars if you could fix the sync issue this app would be the best
1,latest version is buggy it does not sync at all
1,la pubblicità è diventata insopportabile
1,today the pro version said its not pro any longer and asked for payment on another device its still pro
1,get this calendar app if you like to watch daily fullscreen video ads there are calendar apps without ads get one of them instead 
1,what the hell most recent update introduced full screen ads you cannot immediately dismissed happens whenever you add to your calendar developer has officially jumped the shark finding an alternate
1,ads
1,garbage does allow adding exchange calendars
1,i have been waiting for a promised refund since 25th june have sent several emails would appreciate my refund
1,i purchased this app once but for sone reason i now have the free version whats up with that
1,used to be great but just constantly wipes out all my repeat appointments now its become absolutely useless and support never respond i pay for proband its now money down the drain
1,cant add an outlook calendar that isnt on ms exchange so that means you cant add any regular personal outlook calendar thats pretty bad edit the developer response links to a page discussing ms exchangeenabled outlook accounts my comment was regarding nonexchange accounts so the developer didnt even read my review properly
1,i want dedicated column for week number in month view widget added after editors reply i want week numbers in separate column not in sunday column and i do not understand why i have to get votes on forum to get updated feature even if i paid for it
1,i was using it and thought it was pretty goodi had my whole business schedule on it then i lost my phone i got a new phone and downloaded the app again logged on and no schedule it was gone i lost thousands of dollars and had many clients pissed off at me so disappointed
1,i cant add my gmail account to your calendar used to work flawlessly earlier now just wont let me add my account and wont automatically sync data from account
1,garbage fails to notify reminders about half the time unless app tab is open phone and app settings verified missed a long awaited appointment this morningwhy even bother setting reminders
1,with the addition of publicity deep the app lost its productivity side
1,since full screen ads were introduced this calendar app has become very frustrating to use despite having found the app to be one of the best calendar apps available the ads are now too much of a hindrance
1,too much ads in the free version impossible to stop to watch it until the end im not the first to strongly condamn it you reply you are trying to fix it but you set it  should be less aggressive and may be more users customers i waited few months you react and correct it  personaly im unstalling it
1,was a good app but recently started flooding you with long ads that you cant get out of until they are finished playing so annoying checking out other calendars now
1,ads that cover the whole screen later update since you bothered to respond to my review i will elaborate 1 any app that displays weird looking adds ads for games that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps spyware etc you should count yourself lucky that i did not report your app to google the only reason for not doing that is that ive been using your app for some time before the new ad behavior and it was fine 2 lets ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this a business calendar app that sends me adds about online games that i can skip by stopping the app and then reopening really if im a business person what would i want with an online game for children 3 you mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily tough luck i did not make your release schedule you did furthermore i would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app with no ads or far fewer adds i really dont care about the latest releases and most business people dont either we want stable things that we dont need to upgrade every week or so 4 since the ads covering the whole screen started being pushed i realized that your app has little added value over the calendar apps that came preinstalled on my mobile devices and they dont have any adds
1,does not sync not worth it to miss meetings force synced does not typically refresh back to google calendar sync is a big part of being a calendar app
1,im so disappointed ive used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience i finally had to uninstall it because its to the point where its just too much im understanding about banner ads if you dont want to buy the pro version but this is unacceptable
1,it started out great but now theres video ads every time you go into the app to add a date
1,no importexport feature
1,i do understand free means accepting advertising but your recent ads are horrible cannot be shorten and sometimes embarrassing i uninstall now left you two stars for old times sake added after dev response it wasnt the frequency it was the advert that was served i think it was some kind of japanese pornstar not sure cuz i was busily trying to close it to no avail i was in meeting with client checking next date and the unstoppable advert happened simply cannot risk this again
1,has all the features i need however the colors are not customizable i edit a calendar and select a custom color but theres no change applied frustrating
1,ive been asking the developers of this app for years to add the ability for the user change the text color of the day numbers in month view the current gray color doesnt offer enough contrast when using dark themes we also need the ability to add clearly visible grid lines surrounding the day cells in month view two very simple requests that go ignored year after year after year
1,my calendar doesnt show up
1,this was one of the best apps for free out there but now they added these invasive ads whenever you make a new event in the calendar and some of them are like 30 seconds long you cant skip them until its done this app is now hot garbage i dont mind ads they need to make money but 30 second ads about making a social media account or jump scare ads or straight up scams is invasive and abhorrent you guys need to find a different ad service provider
1,1 star prolly less after upgrade u r forcing us either uninstall it or upgrade to pro i am now regretting upgrading it without reading the comments damn old features are already enough for me can i degrade it 5 stars b4 upgrade this is the best calendar i ve ever used the only thing that bother me is that this is not on the ios app store will this happen in the coming days because this is the only reason i am still using android
1,why is it impossible to see text of event i purchased pro version and sent you email i just resent an email  with screenshot
1,update june 2020 do not use this app free version it recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad original review from 2018 great app very customizable and the ads are small and nonintrusive ive been using it for years and had only 1 issue that was resolved after contacting customer support
1,i already paid for the paid version and now they want me to pay again for it or have to put up with ads not cool to have to pay again and again and again as i said not cool to have to pay again and again and again so when my phone needs to be replaced you have changed the apps name so i have to pay for it again other developers allow the user to install the app on their new phone and keep the same features they are familiar with and love doing what you have done creates bad feelings
1,used to be amazing and now ads have completely ruined this app thanks for the years and cya
1,very basic calender outdated ui  not possible to integrate with google task or other task managers few functions for collaborative work  most desired feature of a calender is a ability to add events and add invites from other apps and emails and thats missing
1,i have paid for the pro version inside this app itself but checking the business calendar 2 pro app i still am prompted to pay again why is this why cant i download the pro version even though i already paid for it
1,works fine but the ads are horrible every time i enter something new i have to watch a slow ad im removing it
1,used to be the best calendar available until they decided to put extremely invasive ads i know it requires a lot of work and im perfectly fine with ads im not fine with invasive and deceptive ads trying to trick you instead
1,ive lost an assigment after checking the app for my events for after one year the app showed that my date was free but it was bussy actually at some reason the app just did not synced my events for after one year it cost me my income for the lost event and a lot of frustraion
1,plagued with intrusive ads once was a great app now its useless
1,have paid for pro version used to be decent but now struggles syncing with google whereas other calendartask apps do without problem have now moved to etar as its open source free and provides the same functionality needed
1,there were no ads when i installed it and now every time i put my schedule there is ads so i need to wait its very annoying i will find another app
1,everything is paid
1,recent update crashes the app a few seconds after launch update i know whats causing it i have a root level adblock and with your new full screen ads that get blocked it instead just relaunches the app for me im not disabling my adblock for one app full screen ads unacceptable anyway for an app branded for business use
1,was good but not keeping up with the world having font size a pay feature with todays high resolution displays make the text so tiny that it cant be read so in order to use the free version i have to pay for it
1,support doesnt want to fix issue in event calendar creation or to make this optional for users to decide  there is a bugfeature which moves the event to next day when i specifically selected todays date if i do it after 2300  this logic is flaud  even me as software developer will not decide for my customers such a thing and will put a msgbox do u want to create event tommorow or at least put a check box in options to match user aspectations
1,best calendar app ever but im not giving 5 stars until we get the desktop version we have been requesting for the past 5 years
1,i paid for the ability to export calendars then import them the problem of all imported entries being backdated 1 day has not been fixed in 2 or 3 years dispite submitting samples showing that the dates are inaccurate in the exported file buyer beware  totally useless when you change phones you lose all your calendar entries
1,used it for years great app but uninstalled it after they added adds during editing appointments i use a different app now
1,recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app  im unable to add appointments while i wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish i can no longer use this as its affecting my business it has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap update  the developer responded  said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs this is incorrect an ad appears after every diary entry  other times too i enter multiple entries every day so get many ads
1,whos brilliant idea was to add several holidays which you cant even delete that are not even us federal holidays to this calendar
1,ever since the last update i get invasive annoying full screen ads every time i try to enter a new task seems that the update was designed to ruin the app experience horrible level of service really considering uninstalling
1,used to be great been using for 5 yrs  now tasks dont add other calendars dont show data the only event data that shows up is event data i add in the calendar
1,this apps reminder is always late always late i dont know if there is a problem in my setting but im really not enjoying this app i really dont i thought this app will help me big thumbs down 
1,used to be great app now sucks unpredictable syncing and other day not syncing google calendar on android 10
1,reduced to 1 star after second repetitive dev response edit after dev response i get having ads but full screen ads that you have to wait to skip are very annoying i am fine with ads that appear at the bottom great app until the full screen ads appeared
1,bc2 wont sync with google calendar autosync is enabled but still events created or deleted from app will not sync with online calendar or google calendar app
1,horrible marketing adds every time removing the app
1,am getting reminder notification sounds but with no notifications to dismiss i have raised this issue many times over the years with no resolution happens on lg and samsung various android versions now on android 10 have to force stop the app
1,ads killed an otherwise good app had the old paid version too but that went away dealt with less intrusive ads for a while but now they are out of control
1,had this app since july 2015 and since january it says buy pro which i have done almost 5 years ago support is no help ive contacted them for months with no help just told to uninstall quick fix just uninstall with no promise all info will return 
1,i have paid for the pro version it works for a few months then asked me to pay again sent an email to the support email they replied they have nothing to do with the payment so who does then stay away guys
1,i dont use the free version i like to pay for software that deserves it i tapped on the app today and had an interstitial ad do not do this again for a business app
1,hello i just upgraded to your go pro within this free version but it looks like nothing changed how do i get those pro features where are the widgets do i have to install the pro app i have to buy it again if i did that ive looked it up already please fix this i have already refund your app
1,it was all going good even the irritating adds until today where the app crashed and all my data saved on it are gone im really irritated now
1,iam horrified to find that a lot of my historical data has disappeared from the app the info is vital for my medical records if anyone has an idea on how to retreive it please let me know
1,great format but sucks due to ad popups that wont go away locks you out of app unless you pay for premium version total  complete waste of timedata unless you pay for premium
1,im sad i paid for this app it used to be great but now it keeps lagging and freezing intermittently huawei p30 pro i have disabled battery management tried using original and custom launcher but app still freezes for 5 seconds for many actions nothing works and i cant use it in this state i have no other issues with any other apps  scrolling in week view  creating event  editing event  deleting event sometimes freeze sometimes crash
1,never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesnt answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring do not show in calendar even though you sync this information
1,nope nope nope
1,bad avoid
1, update only manual sync works down to 1  until you fix this best calendar out there love it it looks great works flawlesly erganomics  ease of use is absolutely outstanding and im sure it tastes good as well if you could eat it
1,using the app since years now whenever open the app trying to save an entry full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates this app is at its worst
1,this used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already unfortunately they introduced intrusive fullscreen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version ill rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that
1,if you dont stop to force ads clip watching bye bye
1,i have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out i tried it and there were problems i tried it again and it seems to work well i tried running with one alarm and now it dosent stop when i acknowledge it im going back to the old version i have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs i will have to find a new calendar very frustrated
1,used to love it now its been an issue after issue with this app youd expect that it would perform at least the basic task of reading my calendars doesnt even do that anymore no matter how many times i try to sync it so much for getting the premium version disappointing
1,app starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month
1,it always reactivate calendar from all google account on the device and show it eventhough i have untick it in the calendar  task list calendar is full with unneeded event and the essentials wont show
1,best free calendar is now unacceptable with full audio full screen video ads the price to avoid the ad mugging is ridiculously too much uninstalled and looking for another
1,ads with free apps are acceptable but fullscreen  nonskippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are not awful user experience google has recently removed 600 android apps from play store because of disruptive fullscreen ads this app may be the next one to be removed not recommended
1,awful at one point i bought the business calendar 2 app and i the update has ads im supposed to purchase the newest version yeah no thanks
1,full screen ads ruin it all ive been using this since it was just business calendar it was still 7 back then so i wouldnt buy it but would click the ads every now and then now with the full screen ads its practically unusable also before the dev comes in with the stock the free version has ads response no duh it has ads we didnt pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads now you force them to take over our screens uninstalled and 1star
1,use this app every day and used to totally love it but in the last month or so they have allowed fullpage video ads to take over the screen the only way to get rid of them is to force close the app which i now do repeatedly cant continue like this totally unacceptable what the heck could they possibly have been thinking downright stupid business decision looking hard for another app to replace this one as soon as i can it was nice while it lasted
1,ive used this calendar for years it has always been the best but now theyve added ads unless those go away ill be finding a new calendar
1,waste of time unusable cannot delete events
1,i used to love this calendar but now it has full screen adsvideos that take over your phone cant do anything else while the popup ad is running first one of these i saw  uninstalled  response the ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely not functional while the ads are running  you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again i can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app but full length commercials
1,been using this app for many years the recent update has brought ads uninstalling
1,those fullscreen ads made me uninstall it after years of using it happily bye wont come back my response or you know i can simply use another calendar app thats free and has no ads
1,force feeds users with video ads after each entry
1,been using this app for years this app called itself business calendar but now includes popups which blasts the speaker at full volume how am i supposed to use this app during business meetings like the others who gave their feedbacks guess its time we move on to another calendar app like onecalendar which dosent have ads
1,looks polished app but time after time new issues come up raising these issues with the developer rarely gets timely response or interest in fixing it im a paid user today tasks lost their subtasks on one device while the 2nd device is ok for now  to devs task and their subs used to sync across devices via google drive seems like you eliminated this feature by switching to google tasks in your recent update totally useless app now for me at least
1,i use the pro version but what happened to the option to purchase holidays my christian and jewish holidays dont show up anymore
1,developer started to add invasive ads and worst of all the functionality that was working before is not working anymore probably the app is busy with the invasive ad and forgot about the job at hand  and yes i know about the payed version
1,used to be 5 stars ive used this app for years the sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it it looks like im not alone in my disappointment
1,not into your ads ive had your app on my phone for years uoure about to be deleted for a google calendar sorry
1,do not download this app there are ads everything you use i as of feb 26 2020 despite what the developer says about the 18 hour just read other reviews and youll see that the intrusive ads have killed this free app look for another similar app
1,the ads are a joke completely destroyed the experience maybe they havent tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options look elsewhere for calendar needs
1,ad heavy plus unable to use widget and stock calander app
1,used this app for years but i can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry i use the free version which i know is sponsored by ad the recent updates allow intrusive  excess ads that you can even skip and i cant renter the app to verify my calendar entry was addedmodified corrected the developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads im going back to the free google app instead i hope you push out a new update before y
1,dont bother installing this app the free version is garbage recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads the ads pop up every time you add an event to the calendar the developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app i have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again
1,i am also looking to change after years of usage the app stooping to advertising unless a new upgrade is paid is dishonest i paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality not interested in your new version
1,ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar this app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine now the ads are annoying and timed reply to developer no thanks i rather uninstall your app completely 
1,predatory ads killing it
1,full screen video ads i can live with banner ads but not this
1,this is update on 22 feb 2020 i dont know what happened to the app but it now annoys me every second time i open it with some ridiculous animated games which hijack the whole phone for about 30 seconds and then goes to google play asking to download the idiotic game not sure if its the app itself or if its been hacked in either case i am uninstalling this  excellent app ive been using it for many years now since its predecessor all good with app 
1,i used this calander app for years and found it to be excellent but recently it started playing full page video ads making accessing information on the fly unreliable im sure the paid version is still great but i cant recommend using this as a free calander app anymore
1,ads ads ads
1,loved it until they added cartoon ads youll be with a client and a video game comes up as youre scheduling their appointment makes us look very unprofessional
1,ive had this app for years even upgraded it to the premium version loved it then as the developers started updating i started having many issues each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version it was inconsistent i wrote the customer service for assistance and i didnt get any help so i lived with it most recently i started receiving ads after every entry not okay i sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to which is why im here help
1,i paid for this app and it was a wonderful app easy platform customisable but there has been a recent addition of ads all the time for an app i have paid for i think this is disgusting i response to you no these arent spam events linked to my phone i uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads i was prompted to update to this version a while ago i thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar i had
1,i have used this app for a couple of years now and it was great it had small banner ads before however recently they have incorporated video ads which play every time you input a new plan this is incredibly tedious and a massive waste of time do not download
1,do not install this app i used to love it but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable i am switching to google calendar and never looking back
1,its a great app i used for years i was ok with ads but the full screen cant be immediately banished ads make it unusable when i need calendar info i need it right now ill give it a couple of weeks but if it doesnt go back to discrete corner ads im out edit post response id have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version because it is better than stock calendar but its not 7 bucks better so if youre not going to remove full screen ads after years of using gotta say buh bye
1,the popup advertisements make the free version impossible to use i will be forced to change to a different app after years of use
1,updated and the only thing new is ads deleting after years of use over multiple phones
1,paid for premium and now i keep getting ads after the update
1,misleading all themes require pro
1,unskippable video ads pop up when you are adding or editing an event i mean video ads popping up in a calendar app is bush league already but unskippable may as well have a boxing glove on a spring pop out of my phone and smash my groin  thats probably preferable
1,does not sync automatically very frustrating have to go in and sync now even though setting is set to sync every hour done with this app
1,i am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control edited to add of course the free version has ads always has and i dont mind because something has to pay for app development but these new full page video that cant be shut down in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable that was a bad business mistake you can correct i hope you correct it soon ill be checking back to see
1,since you have put advertisements in app i say goodbye on top of that an update came up and isnt possible to view description of booked day unless you click on it disappointed
1,ads started appearing whenever id modify something not cool edit i have no problems with banner ads but ads that completely disable functionality for a period of time completely defeats the purpose of using this app for better functionality
1,deleting was great now horrible bad move with the ads guys
1,recent addition of very intrusive fullscreen video ads has crossed a line at first i thought my phone had been hacked i totally understand need for revenue for a great free app but this is too much im going elsewhere very soon without a change
1,the free version has horrible ads other than that the app is marginally better than googles free calendar app that had no ads it was an easy decision to uninstall and go back to google calendar
1,i had given 5 stars in jun 2017 im changing it to 1 star because of the full screen ads which cannot be dismissed im grateful to the developer for creating this nice looking calendar app and was happy to tolerate the ads in the free version but the full screen ads really disrupt the process of adding an event to the point where it becomes intolerable ill just switch to google calendar which syncs better anyway thanks for the few years of a great app
1,full screen ads you cant skip every time you add or edit an event 
1,the new fullscreen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable im looking looking for a replacement
1,excellent ui easy to use and sync to gmail events and tasks all at once since the last update on feb 13 2020 this app shows video ad after modify calendar which you cannot close until the ad is finished you have to be careful if you are in quiet environment ie meetings
1,i used past 5 yearsnice app  but now more advertisement so i uninstall the app
1,advertising everywhere now so bye bye
1,i have been using this app for many years definitely one of the best calendar apps for android unfortunately too big desire for monetization of the app won full screen ads which you cannot close are now popping up after adding events and more such a big disappointment you can of course purchase the app but for me it doesnt add any more value as i dont use pro functions i guess its time to switch to googles native app
1,love this calendar up until a few days ago the ads used to be fairly nonintrusive which i get and could totally live with now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar totally unacceptable when im with a customer absolutely do not recommended this calendar as currently configured
1,too many long ads
1,i recently switched over from the original business calendar app which i have been using for many years this version has a fancier ui but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine if it aint broke dont fix it i think other features have been added but i dont really use them update full screen ads suck they appear and cannot be closed for a long time show me an ad if you must but let me close it the free version is unusable this
1,resonse 21320 i know that the free version is not adfree  the issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away and this happens while im trying to add or edit something on the calendar had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads will be looking for a new app soon
1,5 up to 15 seconds are too much for staring at an add in an app that is listed under productivity already expecting the lame excuse given to all the comments please rethink if you want to go the standard way you mention or if a developer should try to give its best and attract users im in favour of ads in free app versions but this is too much
1,my go to for years until the last update ads used to be unintrusive now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run uninstalling now
1,wow had a 30 second ad that gave me the uninstall this app command i used to like the 1st but eventually moved to the 2nd but after that atrocious ad i uninstalled and used google calendar which the widget is not as nice but works great
1,unskippable pop up video adds with sounds awful and completely inappropriate for business as the name suggests i shall look forward to deleting this app and avoiding this developer from now on
1,loved this app until ads started covering the entire screen uninstalled immediately
1,ive used this app for years and have loved it up until now now i get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what im doing i dont mind a full page ad that i can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable seems like theyre forcing you to pay up or move on to another app if this continues ill find another app
1,used to be good but started showing full screen ads even when the app is not open currently unusable
1,i used to like even love this app it was great now though every time i add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished its awful so far the ads have not been inappropriate just annoying i dont think that going to the pro version would fix this i dont even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesnt show up in the play store super frustrating i dont want to find another app i just want this one to work without the silly ads
1,used the free version for years no issues didnt need the pro features then they started putting in ads  not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while youre trying to work worst baitandswitch ive ever seen
1,used to be good now massive full screen adds with sound first time they ran without warning very embarrassing will give it a week to revise then will uninstall adds are ok but the full screen nature with sound isnt
1,full screen ads in a calendar app are you serious
1,the ads now popup full screen that is very very very very annoying what if im on an important call making an appointment and then you popup this irrelevant ad right in my face unprofessional
1,after updating ads took over the screen disappointed ill look into other calendar apps as alternative
1,it used to be the best calendar for many years till now when annoying advertisements are popping up all the time so sad but its totally intolerable need to uninstall and find another app
1,video ads
1,i dont mind ads but not those which run in full screen mode and cannot be closed by me
1,used this calendar for years without any issue now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers theyve lost me as a user as i refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app do yourself a favor and stay away the ads suck and are annoying
1,used this app for months with no issues but after most recent update it plays an ad every time i add a new event to my calender awful
1,would you please add day and night mode for widgets that would sync with systems day and night status thank you
1,doesnt popup reminder anymore with android 10 update  revert by support claiming its purely android 10 issue isnt true there are apps which continue to have popups shared with developer who refuses to acknowledge this  only give defense of android issue
1,great app but why do you need 13 ad trackers in this paid for pro app exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous using this every day but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times edit you inform so that makes it okay then for you perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere how do i confirm the trackers are not used trust you i bet 13 are for revenue 1 will suffice for personalising
1,cant set up reminder
2,excellent app it seems to be upgraded quite often i havent had any issues with this app at all and i have been using it for about 3 yrs importing  exporting is a breeze its a great app with a great dev team keeping it up to date thank you update october 25 2020 as you can tell from my previous review i was quite satisfied with this calendar but since the changes to the interface its nothing but garbage i will be contacting the developer about these changes today see what happens
2,generally its satisfactory calendar app variety of features with clean and productive design the only problem is the support recently there are ads quite frequently popping up in the app when i wanted to upgrade to pro app shows some technical issue on their side i tried to contact support but answer was general and didnt solve the problem at all
2,long time paid user who is very disappointed with the current version i have had several events and tasks disappear as if they were never created i have had this happen for months now and have done multiple tests to see if i am at fault however this issue happens at random i have had events refresh then they are gone nowhere to be seen again ye the quick text will pop up when i attempted to make a new event with the same title so it was entered in but nothing showing same with tasks
2,its been more than a year since ive requested a simple feature of counting the number of hours for certain entries in a month but theres nothing yet developers responded saying its not a high priority because people havent voted on it but what they dont understand is that not everyone is going to put the time to go to their website and vote on ideas but that doesnt mean those ideassuggestions arent important
2,good program but the ads are becoming super intrusive been using for years but im considering changing to something else edit to dev response the ads are not skippable edit 2 no they are not until you sit through them taking off a star for lying developer
2,i find it very inconvenient that when i attempt to save a calendar entry an advertisement pops up and the only way to get rid of it is to close the app
2,great app that now has intrusive full screen ads ugh
2,some crashes new bugs no support of certain calender supports eg fails to import ics and no caldav support
2,i have the paid version of this app and it keeps somehow going back to the free version i continue losing my calendar inputs the widget frequently gets stuck at on the wrong day and date of the week and wont update unless you remove the widget and reinstall i have been screwed over because of these issues so many times its a calendar widget why does it have so many issues edit it does these after a few weeks and yes it has access to everything
2,app just started full page ads that cant be suppressed dropping it after 2 years
2,very crippled app and hard to know if it would work for me unless i buy full version
2,what happened to my ability to use the themes i paid for the upgraded version years ago with the newest update my customized theme disappeared when i was attempting to modify the colors within my theme now i only have the hideous light version with the ugly black borders all the other themes that were previously available are now marked pro and i have to fork over more money to get them back theres something really wrong with this picture
2,doesnt sync well and has left me out of meetings
2,too many ads
2,i will upgrade to 5 once this is fixed i still have to update widgets manually otherwise they still think its yesterday answer to dev yes if i dont press refresh it doesnt update to the current day shrink content is ticked i use stock launcher on pixel 2
2,used to be without ads now the ads are annoying
2,loved the app before the ads now its almost a nuisance to use
2,used to love this app and originally gave it 5 stars it has stopped sinking with my phone for about 6 or more months but functioned perfectly on my phone however for the last couple of weeks my appointment reminders only function occassionally ive gone through the settings on both devices and cant find anything wrong i have reinstalled the app several times but nothing helps i can no longer reccomend this app
2,the app does not synchronize events and tasks correctly with google calendar often the changes i made on my desktop computer are not displayed in the app until the next day or do not synchronize at all until i manually request bc to sync the answer of the developer below surprised me because i bc is advertised as having sync abilities and ii i had already contacted the developer about this issue and the answer was yes we are having some problems with google but we are working on it
2,ive used this calendar app for many many years and loved it now suddenly the ads stop me from finishing my tasks and i have to wait for the x to appear thats fine for games but this is a serious app i use when booking and planning life and i dont need it to interrupt my thought process as that causes me to lose focus and forget things which is exactly why i need a reliable calendar app
2,agree with others that have made comments about the syncing ive used this for years and it has never had an issue then pretty much overnight a few weeks or a maybe a month back something has changed it may be and probably is a google issue but it still makes it unusable
2,does not sync with tablet
2,i really wish i could make this calendar work as i am a big fan of it unfortunately it stopped syncing with my google calendar and so it has become unusable i uninstalled it and reinstalled it multiple times cleared data but still no events showing up from my google calendar edit tried your solution but unfortunately when i removed and readded my accounts now they dont show up at all in the app i tried another app and it syncs fine
2,the ads have become increasingly annoying by going full page where you have to wait for it to do its thing before you can even get into the calendar im all for supporting ads but these kinds of ads that take over are the worse and the family sharing doesnt work for this app so will start looking for something else to use
2,meetings will not save or show in my calendar once i input all the info this started a week or so ago never been an issue before now
2,no longer syncs properly with google calendar
2,lately been worse latest updates have been making things worse like when you edit the time for the event the new way to do it is absolutely terrible and least user friendly way to select times it was perfect and smooth before idk what changed also no response from support for weeks now about bugs i have with notifications clearing when they should not be
2,the best calendar apps in android but it just dont sync correctly i have google calendar apps and it sync flawlessly but somehow business calendar wont sync correctly
2,large full screen ads on the free version that appear every day and cant be removed its not 18 hours of calendar runtime but every 18 hours period if you like it and it is a good app youll have to buy it
2,the ads are more disturbing than before
2,in response to ur reply the reminders literally disappear as though a person has gone into my calender 15 mins later and deleted the reminder set to 0 mins before event
2,too many ads i used to like this calendar see my original rating below  this calendar does everything i need it to do and i enjoyed this app on my galaxy s7 phone now i have an s10 only some content will sync is there an s10 version i dont know about thanks for your help
2,i loved this calender but its really disappointing how often i add something and the next day its disappeared
2,took more than 3 years but theyve finally managed to get bc2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original 3102019 update unfortunately usability is severely compromised busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots 1005 or 1440 clock to set times is backward step from bc1 which is by far the best way to set times on a calendar i like the auto link to contacts in bc2 2 line favorites bar pls
2,migrating to a new phone was completely messedup all my tasks were changed to all day tasks and all appointments hours were lost unacceptable errors calendar can not be deleted  error check your internet connection despite of the fact there was a connection i use pro version  meaning i bought it
2,the new adds system is getting really annoying ads were a footnote in previous versions now they interrupt what im doing  really frustrating
2,ads are becoming really invasive and you have to wait at least 5s each time before you can skip see another ad then come back to the calendar not inclined to buy pro with such bad user experience edit  and most people use a calendar app once or twice a day so i guess dev are aiming for maximum ad visibility i know nothing is free but this is annoying and its video ads for silly games i guess ill uninstall soon
2,4k 7g8 0 3rd v of uhuh
2,advertisement is annoying frequent and increasing i uninstalled after couple of years usage
2,ive used paid version for years and its been great except for the occasional glitch usually solved by reinstalling the app but now an event is suddenly just not showing up ive checked everything tried sync installuninstall change color of event toggle bottom menu tabs checked which calendar its on checked if event shows on google calendar app etc but no the issue is with business cal i would have completely missed this important event if i hadnt checked my calendar on my laptop please fix this a calendar that skips events is useless
2,this is app is something that i use only because i cannot find something better to fit my scheduling needs the amount of bugs in the app and the amount of ads i have to sit through is beyond annoying not sure why they keep pushing for me to purchase something that consistently screws up because of the bugs the biggest bug being adding in birthdays or anything that has a date as instead of putting the date i requested it will put it a day behind or a day beforehand
2,its working but the ads are getting really annoying
2,frustrated  popup ads have become a nuisance far too many i can no longer recommend this app
2,update 3 06052020 adsadsads full screen autoplay ads w noise 1st review many intrusive popunder links open browser subjecting us to crazy ads 121218 reply to devs the popunder ads happen upon selection response to your app message related to the action taken within your app i am not actively selecting an ad i am not passively selecting an ad i am not accidentally selecting an ad this is either a bug or intentionally developed annoyance
2,i really liked the app but now im going to have to find something else they have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive i was in a meeting and i had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and i couldnt close it until the ad was finished it was very inappropriate it is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads i was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive
2,its just a basic normal calendar nothing special about it but now for some reason it no longer shows holidays not even the kost common known ones world wide such as christmas or even new years
2,zסב
2,this calendar was great until the ads they are out of control you can not go back the x button does not work and they are way more often than ever 18hrs as stated by the maker if you can get past the crazy ads then its great but i am over it and cant handle it anymore
2,overall a great app to replace both google calendar app and microsoft outlook app only thing stopping me from purchasing a pro licence that has super useful and amazing features is the fact that there is no windows desktop app 
2,loved it at 1st and then it started going weird even though i purchased a lifetime i purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse tried to reach out to customer service and they werent very helpful at all then you post and say that i only contacted customer service once it was actually over 4 times i contacted you via email and most the time the emails i got back were so difficult to understand and varied in suggestions that didnt work
2,what good is a calendar app if it deletes whatever it chooses to i have used this app for years but this last year i have lost dates that were important for me to remember birthdays anniversaries weddings trips family historical events i wanted to remember pick something this app has chosen to just drop it from my calendar as if i never even put it in i would have given it 1 star but it has kept some things looking for new more dependable calendar app
2,i liked this app and used all the time but popping up ads are now annoying me so much im considering an alt calendar app
2,the app itself is great but theyve started adding unskippable ads it locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where i had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment i had no problem with static ads to support the developers but locking my phone until i played a dumb game ruined the app for me
2,the ads are to loud and in your face
2,really usefuluntill you added ads now they interrupt what youre doing within the app and they are really frustrating were introduced a few months ago i thinksuch a shame
2,new version and now i have to wait 30 seconds and watch an ad just wanted to take a look at my schedule today this is unacceptable 30 seconds
2,calendar works fine but the adds that cant be skipped are making me furious
2,i strongly recomment that you will not use this app if you use outlook calendars fantastic app but only for those using gmail with outlook you will meet various problemsi realized this after purchasing full ap also tasks posiible only by google tasks and attachments only google drive and dropbox one drive not available update after installing blue mail app syncing is working smoothly please give solution for outlook users and add outlook tasks if bluemail could it then yo also do
2,i love this calendar but a few monthly ago they started adding pop up advertisements when i add an item to the calendar very disappointing
2,what happened ever since the last 2 updates all my recurring monthly appointment show up for 2 months and then disappear so now i cant rely on this app to remind me of bills
2,2 many ads i used this for 4 yrs and 2 cell phones no problem i used to brag about this app lol miss me with the excuses about why things changedit helps maintain the app you werent making enough and sold out i respect it but i guess i gotta do the same  peace out and good luck to all those looking for a better app simple calender over  simplemobile tools i hear great things
2,hi i am not able to use the paid version to full kindly help me the help and feedback is not loading itself
2,im changing my rating from 5 to 2 ive used this app for many years and i love it its a great app but they have recently added add on videos skippable but still 5 seconds long  after youve created or closed an event in your calendar app its really annoying and disgusting because you dont have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule youve went to far business calendar 2
2,it was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry how to annoy your users  i wont be forced to pay i have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback good luck
2,pls give us dark theme costfree so my eyes wont die using this app
2,i have had this for years and even have the pro version today the application is staying i do not have pro when i go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features
2,a few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer exchange server i used to make it work manually but now it doesnt work even if i sync now
2,meh i left the meh on 22019 today is 32020 while the calendar is ok the themes never change and really are not anything of interest they really need to be completely changed also color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things i have going onthe measley 7 or 8 colors they have are too few  what no pink a nice hot pink so it will stand out i mean idk im still just meh 
2,it started strong then the ads were a bit much but its free and i was thinking about buying it then events that are clearly on my google calendar stopped showing suddenly yes theyre still on google and show on that app i dont like that app but i might be stuck with it im sorry this didnt last but i am glad the problem developed before i bought it
2,the app doesnt sync after making changes on my google calendar even after hitting the sync now on the app
2,update i know its a one time fee as stated that i had already paid same acct now i dont have pro ive had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away my reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me i do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment  also if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful disappointed that i would have to pay for pro again if i wanted to continue those features
2,i have used this awesome app for 3 years at least sleek convenient powerful but the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads if that is not reverted soon i will have to change app pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of others great job and thanks for your copy pasted answer 
2,have been using this app for years and have loved it however a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it i do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years but with full screen ads no sorry
2,was and is a great app used it for years but now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff small ads down the bottom were fine but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a huge no for me uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that dont force you to wait through adverts
2,55 o
2,first i liked the free version but after a while it got annoying with all the advertisements
2,its the best callendar ive used but letely its been freezing a lot and its annoying because i use it a lot pls fix the freezing edit 6months have passed and this is still freezing why i use my calendar a lot so i cant keep using this
2,nice widget and i dont mind a few ads but persistent ads are annoying when i get annoyed i tend to rather go somewhere else than becoming a paying customer
2,used this app for years but the recent addition of full screen ads is too annoying small banner ads or something similar would be much more appropriate for a calendar app why would i want to look at an ad for half a minute when it should only take 5 seconds to add an appointment
2,multiclick spam to encourage upgrading to pro version
2,how do i go pro does this app only work with facebook i dont have face book
2,please remove the annoying and intrusive ads
2,the free version was great until now but since they added advertisements to it e g forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment i cannot recommend it anymore it is absolutely annoying the google calendar is the better alternative now
2,what i love is that i can make multiple calendars with the same account what are some major problems 1 my events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who i include in the event sending a text message link doesnt work either 2 i have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to this is detrimental ps i paid for premium
2,really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app there are plenty big mistake by the developer
2,after an update started showing really annoying fullscreen ads been using it for quite some time will uninstall
2,best free calendar app ive used syncs with google and outlook calendars edited from 5 to 2 starsthe video ads are too painful ive already read the default reply to the other reviews complaining about this i know the fee is low and one timei promised myself id get the paid versions of all the free software i use once im not on student income but im not rewarding this painful ad practice by going paid i will pay for a different calendar
2,since recent update adverts make the free version absolutely unusable i understand some adds have to be in the free version but full screen adds are very disruptive in a calendar app when one needs to work quick  otherwise the functionality it great
2,no longer the calendar i use since the intro of annoying ads and video ads uninstalled
2,recent update causes the widget to crash every time i go to my homescreen on a pretty common samsung tablet
2,i used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything i guess ill go back the regular google calendar app reply to developer thatd be great if you remove the terrible ads for now im uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps
2,you cant set a location by name only address yes i tried setting my location manually like that would be at all useful do you even understand what im saying i cant type in la fitness and get an address it will just send me to whichever is closest setting my location wouldnt help it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further worthless
2,wonderful app with nice visual hierarchy but now ads take over the entire screen
2,i have to agree that the fullscreen timedraining ads are not viable for a business calendar regardless of the reasoning behind it by all means keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro 6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there such as acal which i used to use before bc and am now reverting to ill keep an eye on business calendar though because if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable ill certainly be back
2,wouldve been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible those kind of ads are fine when youre playing other games but stopping what im doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable i understand the banner ads to keep it running but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far
2,lately the ads have doubled in frequency have become full screen noisy and more difficult to close while the overall usability have decreased quite shame and before telling the its free slogan think that annoyed people will delete not buy
2,it works does what its supposed to do although i dont require any features other than setting an appointmentevent and being reminded of it unobtrusive even when using it as a free version only ill probably upgrade to pro just to reward the developer edit the new 30 second ads really screw this up
2,ive loved using this calendar for years my favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar i havent found any other calendar app that does it this well but recently they ruined the free version by showing fullscreen popup ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work i may have paid for the full version before they did this but not now if theyre going to force uses to pay up 7 to remove such intrusive ads ill just move on to another app
2,loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it too bad
2,loved this app for years the new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away i understand the need for ads but this is too far and i have no need for any of the pro features so i will not pay for it when i can use a different app for free that doesnt block my productivity i used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now i wont
2,i hated the pop up ads
2,app works good but with the latest update 25 seconds of ad for adding an appointment not recommended after the update
2,i used to really love this app as it provides a todo list widget that can show a lot of todo list items compacted into a very small space however it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so im going to be looking for a replacement
2,there are fullsize ads that block your entire screen incredibly disruptive and i dont want to reward that by buying pro there are other calendar apps out there that dont deliberately disrupt your productivity
2,i loved this app until the latest update full screen ads that you cant cancel are just too annoying im outa here
2,the font size is realy small and you cant change it without paying for the full version large font is a basic accessibility feature it shouldnt cost extra
2,this app worked well for a year had ads but i was fine with that the latest update made the ads much bigger appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom i was annoyed but tolerated it then today i got a full screen video add that i couldnt close until it was through thats too much deleted reply to reply i know i can pay to get them removed but i dont want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you cant close
2,the interface is incredible its the perfect organizational app ive always been looking for this is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it i would use this app daily if it would just exist in its own bubble without needing to grab onto 3 emails minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app and if i had known this i would not have used it in the first place
2,since 2018 the app does not register some of the calander input apparrently due to poor internet connection now sitting next to the wifi router and entering all my appointments for january needless to say none were regesterred
2,i bought the previous version and cant use this one full version if not bought too which i think is not ok well why would i have to kip old application i understand but i dont like the idea to have duplicated apps but i raised the reading to 2 starts cause of that
2,i love how personalisable this app is and the widget is fantastic the weather app doesnt always work and my tablet and phone wont sync tasks even when i ask it to manually 
2,overall its a great app that i use every day but what i truly hate is i paid for the full version and since i have 3 google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions im given by the developer it doesnt recognize i bought it because it defaults to the wrong account if they fix and let me select correct amount ill bump my rating back up should have an option sad
2,the app is not working well since the latest update 2370 the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working notifications are enabled so that makes the app useless reinstalling the app doesnt solve anything
2,doesnt show a content of reminder on locked screen even if its correctly set in the settings fix it and ill change my rate btw google calendar knows how to wake up a locked screen and show notifications
2,gtasks sync doenst work calendar sync is ok
2,this is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone and that is only reason i cant trust this app i am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example again by far it is a very very good calendar app
2,this an amazing calender my only problem was i was looking for a calendar for solely for my business  because this app you must sync your calendar it becomes useless because now you have your personal calendar mix with business useless for that purpose i can just use my google calendar
2,doubles and triples all my appointments in my calendar making it hard to manage
2,buggy as hell keeps duplicating events when i edit them leaving me with the old version and the new side by side i keep deleting the old one and it keeps coming back im irritated and im going to look elsewhere now i loved the original business calendar but after giving it more then a fair chance this version is a no go
2,actually it is a good calendar app but on android 10 google calendars cannot be synched without the google calendar app installed on your device you have to sync your calendar by another calendar app or all your bc2 events will stay on your local device only so this means that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app which makes this app useless at the moment i am waiting for a fix
2,why do notes dissapear i pun something today and tomorrow it doesnt show up at all to answer1yes 2local 3 i go in the appmonth viewclick on day boxwrite detailshourall daysavethen it shows up in the app and widget for a few hours and then its gone 4 i have a stable internet connection  what should i do
2,doesnt show a files attached to the event using google calendar
2,for the samsung note 9 newest os update customer service finally figured out the problem and it worked for about a month then samsung sent out a new os  the reminders are firing even more randomly than before just emailed tech support again i have to say i do love the app  tech support is good but response time is slow but unless developers can find away to keep it working no matter what update the phone developers come up with i may have to find a more google friendly app
2,does not sync if i enter an item in the agenda it does not sync with the widget sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget in the widget only 2 items are visable the rest keep saying loading for days now even if i manually sync
2,great for neat month view unfortunately it has started notifying event reminders after the event not good
2,great app but it just syncs to my google calendar making it redundant i wanted to use this for nonpersonal task and keep it separated while using the app i get 40 notifications because it updates my personal calendar as well i gave 2 stars because otherwise the functionality and ui is really nice
2,doesnt sync properly anymore have been using the free version of this calendar app with my google calendar for years without problems but for the last half year or so the appointments dont sync the invites dont get sent it has become unusable and unreliable i have had to switch to the google calendar app now
2,loved this app but recently noticed i really wast hearing the audio from notifications and for some unknown reason although the notification volume for the pro version sounds loud at 100 system volume for notifications this version bc2 sounds half as loud if that to the point its unusable because i rarely hear them update just realized that for some odd reason bc2 calendar notification volume is mappedlinked to ringtone volume and i had that lower than half volume please fix this
2,theres no option to remove time rows in the widget only an option to remove the time bar which is kinda pointless was hoping for a simple layout for the widget to display only days 7 days without all those crowded rows of time displayed would otherwise give it a 5 star
2,great app with one major flaw when entering addresses and selecting from the drop down options the house  disappears and leaves only the street city and state without the actual house or business number this is a huge problem for me
2,i have used this app for my business for a looong time and love it however can someone explain to me why im getting spam notifications from bc2 announcing my winning stuff like shoes and iphones at least once a week this happens and as i said i use it for my business and dont really have time to forward these things to 10 of my friends via whatsap which i do not use if its you guys stop it if its some other hijinks then let me know how to fix it please
2,like the look but it messes up straight away instead of saving an entry the app cashed and deleted it instead dont get
2,good  the only thing it has that isnt on my samsung cal is agenda view crappy my scal has dark mode buscal  you can basically f off if youre vision impaired font size  dark mode are paid only not fun to test drive in the bright white light uninstall
2,i loved this until recently many entries disappear panic attack i cant count on it anymore what gives
2,downloaded for the widgets you gotta pay for the widgets before even seeing if they work
2,acalendar  business calendar  tiny calendar  tick tick pro acalendars design featurr and logic is from 2004 business calendar is better but still stupid and feels like from 2010 tiny calendar really improves from the 2 above nice modern design and good dragdrop feature but still suffers the same wrong logic and bad design as business calendar tick tick is the modern calendar that wins because its designed with modern logic designed with proper modern features less touchpoints and jus
2,such a cool app with deal breaking bug this calendar app could be perfect for me but notifications simply refuse to work
2,everytime i snooze an event it disappearsthis calendar is useless maybe i did not explain properlyit does not dissapear as in not in my calendar as an eventwhen i have set a reminder alarm at i get a notification pop up i snooze it for 30min i do not get another reminder in 30 min
2,my data is now disappearing frequently or often is suddenly double or triple in my calendar
2,would be great but almost everything you need to customize it when you first install it is pro only you cant customize font settings  its pro you cant import old calendars  its pro how am i supposed to start using your app then
2,get multiple entries of same appointment problem is with outlook and exchange 360 occurs with other calendars too
2,using google pixel 2 and paid for full versionsometimes the day on the calendar doesnt update i dont want to have to restart my phone everday a workaround would be to press the refresh button on the calendar but i dont like having to do that every day
2,2 stars right now because all my appointments are gone before 2018
2,first time opening good experience everything from google calendar was synced then stacked up my events for the day opened the app a few hours later and absolutely everything was blank and you have to pay 7 to be able to drag and drop your events
2,heres a tip if i disabled a calendar i shouldnt see its tab at the bottom of my screen at all times why do i need to see holidays for each account on my phone across the bottom ill be uninstalling this
2,use to love this app as ive had it for well over a year just recently it magically deleted all my appointments with no way of getting them back tried everything from resetting to reinstalling no resolution i paid for the app so was a little disappointed that i have to look for another app and reenter all my appointments 20 a day
2,فقط احتاج ان اضغط عليه لاري باقي النتيجة ثم يعود لما كان عليه مرة اخري
2,why is it so fiddly to get items to abutt next to each other i end up entering the time manually
2,приложение выглядит нормально но с эргономикой в настройках уведомлений проблема ux дизайнер не работал несколько раз пытался включить звук в уведомлении тк напоминание срабатывало без звука только с вибро в итоге ничего не вышло зачемто три вкладки в general  notification sound невнятный перечеркнутый динамик позже стало понятно что это не статус звука а сброс мелодии почему кстати не к default рингтону  не вышлоповтор напоминалкиесли пропустил напоминаниене работаетудалил
2,this calendar would be a 5 star except for 1 major issue the sync is unreliable for example items placed on my calendar via google or gmail within the previous 2448 hours usually do not appear no matter what sync settings i have or how many times i manually initiate a manual sync all other calendar apps i have tried do not have these sync issues
2,not much use
2,the only thing i cant stand is every time i get a notification i get two notifications for the same event i sure its a setting but i cant find it
2,not a power user with a massive calender of events so i dont need the full blown pro version but there are a lot of basic features under pro only no thanks
2,is a good calender but a few singapore holiday was on the wrong dateie hari raya puasa was on 56 but calendar show 46 deepavali 2710 was show wrongly on 2610
2,sync is very broken have to keep removing and relinking my account seems to stip syncing again after a few days and theres no warning the app is no longer synching this app has the best designed widgets so am heartbreakon by the idea i may have to uninstall as its so unreliable
2,task function work normally but even if i add an event it is not applied
2,better than google calendar but has bugsfor example it keeps restoring deleted events after i delete themi cleared cache memo and restarted phoneuselessstill the same banana updateyes i did remove gmail account but no useit seems a bug between localhost and oppo accounts as it shows both colors for the same birthdaybtw i tested removing oppo account or localhost then i get a bug free part of the calendar but it bugs again after that part updateyes 2 entries but for a certain period
2,it was good until the recent updates i installed this app because of its widget however the recent update destroyed everything that i have customised there are a lot of setting to make the widget looks good but the update limited the setttings i event went all out in purchasing the app thinking it could be like it used to be maybe i can change it back with unlimited setting but its not as good as before im disappointed
2,wont refresh widget after android 90 update
2,dont like it much event task favorites at the bottom confusion entering data is tedious too selected hide for completed task it may have deleted them need simple customization features and i hate the computer time task settings which it uses pros easy to read overview thx mbf
2,the widget keep loading and cant use it after i switched of my phone
2,after the last update i had to clear the cache  data clear the cache partition then lose all my events to stop the double notificationsreminders this has been a great app for many years and this is the first time ive had trouble with it it was a pain to go through all that to fix it but thats how much i like this app i have a galaxy s9 with latest io update update no matter how i set my reminders the maximum  i could get it to alert was two i gave up  went back to bc pro ugh
2,great features and easy to use but have uninstalled it as i get constant messages that it is using intensive amount of battery in the background which it is was battery life much improved with it gone such a shame
2,main issues to solve 1 in the icon app there isnt the indication of current day would be very useful to have it instead of the standard bc violet icon 2 there isnt the possibility to set two different time zone in the fields from and to in the same event it would be very useful to set fights event with different time zone 3the location link should be synchronised with google maps results not with the contacts in order to have the right response for the addresses please update
2,widgets bc2day pro not sync with current time bar it will happed if you leave 2 hours then time also not update in current time line bar i have set background running rights to this app but still not working team please advice me
2,full featured but does not send invitations unless i manually go and view them not dependable
2,a glorified stock calendar as tech support calls it the native calendar app forget it if you have an outlook calendar notwithstanding what appears on the app only exchange is supported seems they spent more time on bells and whistles than the underlying architecture of the app
2,calendar setting are changing from one day to another has to reset them everyday plus widget settings is separated from the app setting which is somehow cumbersome
2,niet te synchroniseren
2,i used to love this app it worked flawlessly for me and it was my goto calendar app however recently i am having trouble where it does not sync anything other than my single outlook calendar with my other calendars being visible from my phone but not having the events also populate on my laptop this is a huge problem for me and definitely a deal breaker if this cant be resolved ill have to start looking elsewhere for a calendar it still is a nice calendar app but if you want seemless integration between your phone and your laptop look elsewhere
2,i thought bc2 was going to be very good for my multiple personal projects it looked well developed and at first its help looked good  but i had to abandon it because its help turned out to be useless  it never mentioned any issue i needed answered as a learner of the program  thus i just could not learn the program  the help may be better for other people
2,i like it its very useful but i hate that shows my email address i dont want others to know my address and pisses me off that the app doesnt even have an option to hide it when you solve that ill rate 5 stars at the bottom it displays a bar with 3 labels calendar_displays my email which i dont want to show and birthdays i dont share but i have to show my schedule to some people some times and i dont want them to see my email
2,not stable some events duplicated and disappear
2,this has been my calendar app for a long time and is one of the best ones out there however ive had to abdon it and go back to google calendar solely due to the way notifications work with this app notifications for reminders dont sync between android devices like most android apps when you dismiss a reminder on one android device it still shows up on other android devices i often work on a chromebook throughout the day and dismiss calendar reminders from the android app running on the chromebookfrom there however when i later pick up my android phone i have to dismiss all the same reminders again very inefficient when operating this way day after day
2,i used to love this but now i need to pay an insane amount or have both the pro and free versions both on my phone if you already have purchased the old business calendar pro you just have to keep it installed on your device to activate all the pro features of business calendar 2 unfortunately we have no possibility to automatically check if you are a pro user of bc 1 we can only check if the old bc pro app currently is installed on your device 
2,in the first business calendar it integrated well with business tasks and toodledo now no such support appears ill go back to the old one
2,very nice app with a bad drawback todays repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless i mark yesterdays task as done heres how this is very bad for me   i have many recurring daily tasks and its a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done even those that were not done it gets much worse if i dont use the app for a few days then i have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day   the app forces me to record false information a task that was not done on a specific day should stay there as not done and the recurring task should be generated for the following day   you have only 3 options for a recurring task 1 to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day 2 not to mark it as done and it will never recur 3 to delete and it disappears and naturally it will never recur  a recurring task should recur regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done
2,wont sync my google account
2,permissions its all or its none wont operate attachments cant do it unless you go into a desktop pc browser on google calendar
2,i have us holidays turned on and some holidays are showing but many major holidays stopped showing such as thanksgiving and christmas
2,would have been nice to explore more features without having to go pro right out of the gate im not down to pay for something that supposedly works without trying it for myself could have easily enabled more options that entices the user other than the bare bones vs ill stick with google for the time being
2,it was good but i guess google is sabotaging it so i lost a couple of notifications removed it and started using google calendar and notifications are now ok sorry  i have uninstalled the program since i missed an important appointment i can no longer trust it  probably the solution you provide works but i think it you should force the user to check those settings on start so one doesnt miss appointments
2,i want a calendar that is independent of my existing calendar
2,it used to be a great app but since you took away ability to changedelete a single event in a series of the recurring events  its not good for me any more 
2,checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single scrollable homescreen widget  unfortunately although the app has the option to repeat a task from the completion date the functionality is broken  for example i scheduled my test task on a tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date the app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule so that it would say something like repeat weekly on thursday on completion date  now having a day of the week and also from completion date makes no sense so i was curious what the app would do i set my tuesday task to repeat every thursday from completion date and checked it off on a sunday the app should have rescheduled the task for the following sunday but it didnt it scheduled it for the following tuesday and completely ignored the thursday and the from completion date  sorry business calendar 2 but thats just not going to work
2,love the app but it became annoying with the upgrade requests bye update reinstalled but useless now that theyve gotten cheap with the themes i have visual issues so require a darker theme only light theme is now free
2,whats going on with addresses is the calendar no longer connected to a map when i start to type in an address i dont get any matches please fix
2,i liked this app but stop deleting events i add on i cant keep readding events every hour im getting frustrated and will have to uninstall unless its corrected
2,office 365 integration doesnt work so its basically useless as a business calendar as a private calendar i dont see any big improvement over google calendarbut its not worse either
2,cannot add multiple accounts
2,this app just disappeared two of the recent events i listed in both weddings luckily i thought of rechecking a day after inputting them this has happened a couple of times already too unreliable for work appointments i might get fired when i rely on this apps widget for work appointments close to uninstalling after i check out a good replacement
2,ive been using the app since 2014 and the app started to log especially the widget agenda widget doesnt work properly
2,kept using it for two years but stopped now because of the intrusive ads they started displaying switched to another app
2,can i optionally show chinese lunar calendar to this app like google calendar putting 2 stars just to get developers attention this app is 45 stars
2,the events are getting auto dismissed after the end time i dont even see a setting option to remove this behavior
2,every entry gets copied so i end up with 2 of everything one in the color i designate and the other in the standard color if i delete 1 i loose both i used this calendar for years for my business and loved it but the latest update killed it
2,dont support jalali shamsi calendar
2,didnt sync my google tasks
2,will not let me add an office 365 calendar only offers google calendar or local calendar as option would be 5 stars if i could sort this as the week to view etc are perfect edited my review but the actual app doesnt offer me an option to add the accounts so still poor
2,bug found a whole week if appointments keep disappearing a few hours after i put them in
3,this app has been mostly great however in the last couple months the widget has stopped working sometimes i wake up in the morning or check my calendar in the middle of the day and it says its the previous day and none of the buttons will work the only thing i can do is restart my phone one plus 5 edit i am using stock launcher and i have changed battery optimization to off we shall see if that fixes it thank you for the reply
3,the dark theme not being automatic when phone is switched to dark theme is very annoying
3,ive used this pro version for years and it does everything i want including syncing well with multiple outlook and exchange calendars my only gripe is that if i need to make entries or edits to multiple appointments or events the app freezes after a few entries and i either have to wait for several minutes even if i kill the app or reboot to get the calendar back ive learned to live with it but would give 5 stars if this was fixed
3,not a bad calendar but the try constantly to make you go pro by blasting adds in your face like facebook
3,would have rated five stars if not for the ads and task option easy to use numerous options for reminders frequency and snooze time it would be convenient if the task selection could be selected from the date and time setting page ad frequency and placement have increased  an ad for pills just popped up after selecting a snooze option this is creepy
3,good app but a lot of advertisement
3,requires service calendar storage this was uninstalled from my device and so this app will not work ps i did find an app yhat doesnt require calender storage also changed to 3stars as i gave the app 1 star by mistake 5he new score is ment to be neutral
3,the user interface is great but the app is not reliable synching with google calendars at times an event i enter on the app does not show up on the google calendar website when my wife enters an event in business calendar on her phone sometimes it does not sync with my phone even though she shares her calendar with me it works 90 of the time but a calendar is mission critical i have missed important appointments due to this app no problem with the samsung calendar
3,the app itself is pretty good but havent been able to sync my business task app with it i reached out to their support team and they were unable to resolve the issue after a couple attempts
3,event notifications dont sound
3,works well and i used to really like it but the new way they do ads is super annoying and you have wait until theyre finished playing before you can close the app uninstalling
3,new issue  widget updated events in calendar are not reflecting in agenda widget even after hitting refresh prior issue was that repeating events werent showing 2015
3,the app is good however i am annoyed with the way it searches for keywords in a appointment there seems to be a random way it does this by searching from a particular date going backwards and then a particular date going forward for which i have no control over all i want to do is search within the current month for a keyword that should be simple to find if i can tell it or set it to search the current month as opposed to random before and after time that the app determines
3,dear support the details location is not showing even after following your instructions also how to add the widget so i can see the upcoming task in my screen
3,it works great and it is really useful but the tasks dont sync between devices and thats really annoying
3,the calendar is very good but in the last month all holidays have disappeared although the whole year that i have been using the free version everything was fine i would not like to change but if you dont fix it i will change the calendar 
3,good app with lots of features if used as a standalone app a bit annoying if you need to rely upon the feature which allows syncing with other systems such as google account this has never worked reliably for me occasionally it no longer syncs and im disconnected for a week before it starts working ive asked for help but the blame was put on my samsung android phone im on the second phone with similar issues maybe this just doesnt work well with android phones 
3,nice app but would like to have option for rounded corners for widgets
3,ive been using this happily for years but i have realised that it desperately needs ical feeds functionality to make it perfect i need to see personal and work calendars and an university provided ical feed all in the same place update a year on from my last comment and a university year and this still doesnt seem to support live ical feeds from a url oneoff ical import has always been there but this will leave me with a potentially out of date snapshot of my timetable rather than the latest version
3,lots of ads but otherwise user friendly and functional
3,i wish it had more imogees for my business i am a wedding officiant
3,is it just me or did all my tasks disappear after this update and no could not import old tasks have started the local sync now
3,aplikácia je v poriadku má množstvo možností dlho ale riešim problém že keď mám viac kalendárov ktoré zdieľam tak sa tento kalendár akoby nesynchronizuje skúšal som jeden účet na dvoch zariadeniach informácia neprešla do druhého zariadenia skúšal som vytvoriť zdieľaný kalendár informácia neprešla do druhého zariadenia skúsil som si skontrolovať kalendár na webe a informácia nie je ani v kalendári na webe tento stav sa opakuje a informácie o udalosti sa nezapíšu ani po viac ako 24 hodinách sú ale lepšie dni kedy synchronizácia prebehne bez problémov nejedná sa o problém hw pretože tento stav je dlhodobý a medzi tým som vymenil pár zariadení pri vašej aplikácii ma držia už len výborné widgety
3,great free app but please do not put a forced ad when i go to save a calendar event i have a busy lifestyle and find it very frustrating to have to wait for your ad to play out before i can save my event really annoying actually put your ad at the bottom of the screen but please dont force an ad right in my face only giving 3 stars for now
3,i dont like the monday to sunday format it will be better if it is sunday to saturday format because 99 people follow sun to sat format
3,ive been using business calendar for many years and its been wonderful however ive noticed in the last month or so that events no longer synchronize if i open google calendar everything syncs this should happen without google calendar and always has before im hoping this is fixed soon as business calendar 2 has been a mainstay on my device for many years and has been my favorite
3,i think your web site is down so i cant resolve issues with the application most of which seem to be attributable to carddav connectivity how can i get installation documentation
3,best calendar over there but still doesnt follow androids dark theme
3,i love the calendar its features and how it works there are way too many ads recently to number of ads increased emensley im looking for another app
3,not so great add birthdays and they disappear as soon as i save used to love it now looking for another love to response below do not want you reading contacts they are mine not yours why cant i just put in a birthday and have it show up thanks for responding
3,clean and clear simple but effective
3,love this app but it  my exchange outlook calendar stop syncing even manually every few days not email just calendar any ideas why
3,will give 5 star if we can edit a recurring event for today only changing recurring event changes all the future event as well what if i only want to change for today only and keep future as it is add options to change subtask position like changing position for subtask three to the first subtask
3,seems i have to rebuy the app evey year or two because all of a sudden it doesnt recognize my license
3,i ended up using a third party task list a few of the problems 1 cant manually reorder tasks by dragging and dropping 2 tasks dont have duration so you cant block out time on your calendar to do the task 3 the worst one  if you want to view one task list it turns off reminders for all other task lists unless you remember to turn the view on for all the othersand as you can see from the reply below this is standard behaviour so interpret that how you will 
3,the wiget is not synched up w the server it worked until 2 days ago i had to delete the widget recreated a new one and all the events show up again
3,the one thing i dont like is the alarm cant shut off without losing the event
3,very fullfeatured app taking off a star because unfortunately the ads are way too obtrusive often times it makes you watch a 15second or more or at least it seems like it ad before you can save a new calendar entry another star off because the design is starting to look dated if you dont care about either of those things then it would definitely be a five star app
3,what happened to the repetition option it disappeared with the last update edit i uninstalled  reinstalled  that fixed it
3,would give five stars but its too confusing in case ie there is an event from the 15th the calendar actually marks from the 16th and just invert colours on the 15th then again im probably not the first one disliking such scheduling
3,this app paid version lost several medical appointments that i had copied in from mychart  theyre all just gone as in poof i like the app otherwise but thats irrelevant when it fails in basic functionality   edit found them in family  upped from 2 to 3 stars why is it so hard to create a simple calendar that only has one calendar database unless you tell it otherwise
3,full screen ads 05 edit  raised to 35
3,the widgets keep disappearing from my home screen response to dev i use both the bc2  day pro and the bc2  week widgets and they both will disappear randomly and at the same time not separately i am using nova launcher i have other widgets which do not ever disappear on their own edit response to dev im trying with the stock launcher now but sometimes it will take a day sometimes a couple weeks
3,it is too slow regeneration takes too much time
3,love it using the payed version update 20200705 doesnt sync some changes any more on my note 9 tried different things i dont have time to spend on debugging i give up and just use google calendar although it is not as nice
3,nice app but uses too much battery it took 13h to drop from 100 to 75 and 87 of that drop was this app bit disappointing
3,i quite using the calendar ads were overbearing was a great calendar today i modified my review and took away 1star 4 star to 3 star because of all the advertisements and the advertisement takes control of your phone this is unacceptable yeah you give everyone the 18month canned statement still unacceptable how would you like some inserted themselves into your life every 18hrs whether you liked it or not every 18hrs is unacceptable and yes i know i previously mistyped 18months
3,ifthe change log doesnt change why would there be another pushed update which causes the date of latest update available to change  i dont understand why youwouldnt want to distinguish that part of the update is new and part is older as yousay for instance ui improvements and add another widget option instead of having description basically unchanged
3,overall i like this app but i use it to make appointments and it is very annoying that it wont link the name with the phone number frim the contacts automatically you can do it manually but it would be way quicker if it would link it automatically
3,e13
3,good has what you need from a calendar however ads are far too frequent and some ads that you show contain jumpscares which makes me uncomfortable using the app i know ads are not in your control but 599 is far too expensive to pay for what the pro version actually offers i think more people would be happy to pay if it was 299 i like this app but unfortunately will have to delete it for this reason
3,still learning about it
3,works but no privacy sniffed out information from my phone that i didnt even know existed full personal details of contacts i didnt even know these sends information to google not necessarily correct one sent events to google calendar but didnt send the cancellation of the event its basically a nice interface laid over the google calendar not what they write independent from google calendar in the manual they are very clear about this
3,i have been happy for the most part with this app however theres a really terrible feature that has been causing me problems every time i try to set a new event it seems that the app is trying to predict what time i want to go in the end time based on what i put in the begin time and vice versa so i get into this stupid loop of having to change both the start and end time several times each in order to get it where i want it it seems like it is potentially tied to the ampm buttons
3,this was my ultimate favorite calendar better than apple google or samsungs calendars now every time i add an event a video ad pops up and i have to wait to see my calendar the ads wouldnt be so annoying if i could get rid of it sooner but there isnt an x for several seconds i may have to switch to google i would buy the pro option but you dont have an apple version and i will probably switch to an iphone soon
3,i subscribed to premium version and it was just working perfect i rate it 5 star but after latest update icon widget is not working one more issue is there in agenda view hide declined view option not actually working and declined events are keep showing for the whole day
3,i have paid to upgrade this app as i find it great using over years however i wasnt able to transfer the paid pro version to my new cellphone what do i need to do to recuperate
3,the app does not support various calanders from outlook
3,month widget failed to show the calendar month erroneously but just show a week on the first row of the calendar month weirdly
3,after last upgrade widget calendar date not automatically rolling over to next day also the widget will not reload when the phone is turned back on
3,i used to love this app it has great widgets and interface however about a month ago it stopped syncing my work events and now they wont even appear turns out the account was removed i reentered the info and nothing came back
3,i bought the pro version a few months ago and i have been very impressed by how well it worked and how useful it is in my everyday life i am however suddenly having trouble recently with the widgets becoming unresponsive if i remove the widget and add it again it works for a while and the stops working again after a few hours i am running nova launcher on a xiaomi redmi note 7 please assist
3,works well but adverts are intrusive and annoying after using for several years now uninstalled and gone back to google calendar 
3,used to be great ads are now far too intrusive and unprofessional
3,i have an issue with the repetition function sometimes it doesnt appear im using the paid version 
3,i have been using this app for several years i was absolutely happy with all the options it had in its free version a few versions back app started to drain my battery much faster and about the same time they added a really intrusive advertisement showing ads all the time when using it i thought i will work through it but no it is very annoying so i must say goodbye when they stop with those ads i will be happy to come back but not like this edit after answer from developer it is not true what they write  i get ads all the time not just every 18 hours  probably because i am not villing to watch them till the end and then they always come back again also skipping them via back button does not work very wrong concept of ads handling no thanks already switched to another app
3,devloper add all the features of google calender apart from this app features i request to your team devloper to incorporate the lawyers dairy for court cases updating facility as per client court type etc in calender then it will awesome and more useful 
3,pretty good but wont sync with outlook cal and popups every so often
3,i have had some problems over time with losing calendar items and duplication of events i ended up having to switch to outlook
3,wish adding attachment and links are easier
3,its assistance on screen seems to display the wrong resolution when using widgets
3,the functions of the app is great but the video ads causes me extremely high data usage and thus money i am ok with ads but please provide options for nonvideo ads asap
3,edit since i cant seem to respond to your comment i have the feeling the fullscreen apps appear more often than once every 18 hours although i admittedly am not sure about this but the x icon only appears after a timer has run out which is partially why theyre so annoying i do understand the need for ads and that a lot of work is put into the app and i appreciate all your hard work on it 
3,i cant seem to think it so i lose my calendar after 3 months and all my appointments is also ridiculous amount of popup ads it would be better if forwarding dates this could be 1 step sometimes it is rarely
3,i recently signed up and paid to upgrade to business calendar 2 pro but am not sure how to activate need advice
3,if it wasnt for the timed ads maybe if they were just a one page ad i would be more inclined to use it the fact they did that is to force you to buy the pro version if they had not i would be more inclined to buy it because at first when there were no ads i was really enjoying the product and considered buying pro then i had to wait 15 seconds for an ad to finish to save an appointment on my calendar which turned me away from using
3,missing snooze ability other functions work well
3,too many long advertisements when i need my calendar
3,sometimes gets dates wrong eg religious holidays not as intuitive as others ok for basic use
3,it would be higher rating but i cant delite some events i dont need anymore for example i still have reminder to pay a credit card which i dont have anymore for 2 years if there is a way of deleting the same please tell me ill give it 4 stars also too complicated time consuming setting exact time you want a reminder for an event
3,def prefer this to google calendar wish it was easier to see and switch to month view
3,i was like great wit it until it erased all my schedules then like magic gave em back 4 that month
3,i have been using the app for some time i guess about 2 years the functionality is very good but here comes the tracker list adcolony applovin chartboost facebook ads flurry fyber google analytics inmobi ironsource mintegral moat tapjoy unity3s ads appgenix says only for the free version check with wireshark in progress
3,it serves its purpose i have not used too many others to compare i wish i could set different reminder sounds i hate the ads after adding an appointment sometimes i have 2 things to add and have to wait which is not ok when coordinating with a doctors office
3,every now and then appears to disconnect from certain calendars support didnt have an answer otherwise i love it
3,great app but its not syncing properly please fix
3,hate the ads
3,full screen ads
3,awesome until i was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar this app had some features that made it better than google calendars that is until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment now when i save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad i didnt get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker
3,why arent holidays showing up on my calendar
3,the new video ad is really annoying it pops out and no way to close it unless you close the entire app it really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar
3,ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
3,recently the app has shown a bug in repeat appointments i always have repeated 3dayappointment for friday saturday and sunday it starts in the evening of friday and ends next sat morning saturday evening to next sunday morning and sunday evening to next monday morning after monday the appointment repeats every 5 weeks it used to work correctly until mid 2018 now the sundayeveningtonextmondaymorning appointment appears in the week before the correct week please fix it thanks
3,est ce que vous avez une version de business calendar pour les laptop 
3,now you get a 30sec ad whenever you create a new calendar entry still an excellent calendar
3,the full screen ads are intrusive and seriously hinder the free versions usability before the ads this was a very solid and handy calendar app
3,very customizable and easy to use works great with google calendar but i cant get it to sync with my office 365 outlook account bummer
3,great appnew adds not so much
3,works great but when i start creating events and switch to a different app and go back to business calendar they disappear also very limited unsearchable collection of emojis no statistics on events too would also love to see goal tracking needs prioritizements of tasks also no option to find a time for an event
3,after last update all infos gone shame on you android never more
3,paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again
3,i schedule a 9 am meeting in pennsylvania while im in california but when i get to pennsylvania my 9am meeting is now off by 3 hours i would like the times to be fixed no matter where i am
3,would be 5 stars because its really great the best calendar ive ever used but it keeps losing things i enter where i have poor reception its like it thinks it has uploaded them and then forgets them somehow
3,the app crashes quite often recently but when it works its really useful to manage events and meetings easy to use
3,ça fait le job sans plus lergonomie nest pas des plus brillante
3,8418  id give five stars if the weather showes in celsius other than that the app is absolutely great i ended up getting the paid version because i felt like the developers deserved it for making such a versatile scheduling tool 2012020  the degree still does not change to c even if i change it on darksky fixing this would be very helpful especially that this has been noted almost 2 years ago
3,weather not accurate it would be nice task have options on bottom of calendar too
3,functional but not very stable
3,app is easy to use but there are 2 features i find annoying when i add calendar items that i have entered multiple times before i would like the event data to default to the same data usually used for this event  even when im adding an event for the 50th time i have to overlay the time duration  reminder the other is that my reminders dont always remind me take today for example  i would like them to keep reminding me until i clear them even if that takes all day
3,its good marginally better than the one that is standard with the phone
3,easy to use but needs better or customizable colors
3,great app when it works but dont assume you will get any support when it doesnt always read our help files and that is it
3,i have been using this app for years and have loved it but the latest version is sucking my battery its very frustrating
3,im considering uninstalling this previously wonderful app since the last update the widget has gone completely unresponsive
3,very pleased practical and clear upset that 1 i paid for and installed an upgrade on my phone but this did not happen on my tablet all i get is advert for upgrade but at extra cost 2 tasks is accessed in 3 steps why not 1
3,great overall somewhat limited
3,overall decent functionality but clunky execution the premium version has good calendar functions but the notifications are spotty and dont work well with my phone which defeats the purpose for me the sub task feature is nice but organizing them is difficult
3,my wedget doesnt update weather help
3,latest update broke google task can not synchronize try to log out and can not add google task again
3,beautiful widgets  in month view i would prefer colored bars with text inside the same as for full day events syncing with ms exchange pros calendar  far better then samsung calendar cons tasks  completely missing five stars down
3,thanks for your comments why does google calendar sync perfectly and bc not when all on the same account i think some while ago possibly due to an update this stopped syncing reliably either regularly or even when sync button pressed in business calendar menu deleting an event on this samsung galaxy phone sometimes forces a sync sync is important as i use this with google calendar on desktop previously wrote easy to use and great that i can copy appointments
3,i have an issue of widget stretching are there any debugs
3,dont have any options to manage daily expenses
3,i really like the sophisticated display and the level of personalisation you can make it would get 5 starsbutthe default text colour for the month display widget is a dark grey that is too dark to read when using the dark theme i have to go through every entry to change them individually to a light grey so i can actually read it in the widget any help
3,ok its sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday
3,the app was working great up until recently now i cant click on the date and update it directly through the widget i have to open the app and make changes through there what happened 
3,please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget andor monthstyle display
3,was very happy with the widget but the refresh button stopped working outlook 365 edit events from google calendar are synced fine events from outlook 365 to mobile device sync fine but edit them do not sync them back manually refreshing from the widget does noting for outlook 365 manually refreshing in the app works without problems these are all actions when using the device nokia 61 and not in battery saving mode
3,its decent but the google tasks integration is bad its set to hourly sync but doesnt actually update tasks unless i manually trigger it the repeating tasks data is not synced with google if its due to repeat in bc but i tick it off on a google webpage then its gone no repeat im also having a problem with notifications appearing later than they should all in all im going back to google calendar
3,this app cannot be useful to me until it works with dav synchronized task lists for some reason it is able to load calendars from the davx app but not tasks
3,works fine for importing calendar cant say same for tasks os linux
3,ui too complicated not very user friendly
3,average app no worth
3,i like this app and have been using it for a while but have started noticing appointments i put in the calendar dont sync to google and some how disappear out of my calendar so i have no idea when they are extremely frustrating since i dont always notice the appointment has disappeared
3,i used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new samsung 10 the google tasks sync has stopped working it synchronises from google to business calendar but will not synchronise from business calendar to google  i have tried disconnecting my google account and reconnecting ive made sure bc2 tasks is associated with my google account and all sync settings are turned on is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please thanks
3,overall it works but not so easy to use when you block out time the first and last day of the time block do not turn the same color as the rest so it can throw you off sometimes its hard to set specific dates and the icons are limited
3,im changing my review from 5 to 3 my husband uses the same app for his work and private events so i also bought this however for some reason and weve already tried every troubleshooting we can think of his calendar private calendar wont show up on mine although it does show up on google calendar ive tried reinstalling so many times but to no avail only very few events of his would show up on my calendar and not the whole thing im not sure whats going on 
3,like the app so farbut i went into the settings and changed the appearance of my standard view to monthyet everytime i open the appthe standard view shows day instead of month
3,the new update remove the option to change only one event when it is on repeat now i need to copy and select and could have more colors paid version
3,sometimes the app will just stop working or the widgets wont work
3,the feature of customization for repeating calendarevent function has disappeared when attempting to modify it used to asked do you want to delete all calendarevent in the series or delete this particular function except for grandfathered calendar functions the feature of attempting to delete a particular calendar functionevent no longer exists
3,task management is a bit dangerous can forget to enable a list also cant figure out a way to view a single list without disabling all other lists which ties into first point
3,great but over half the time when i edit a task it changes the year to the 1960s even though it says 2019 when selected
3,ok i guess
3,seemed like a decent enough app but i was looking for a calendar that worked with google but that i could add local photos to events with a feature currently lacking in google calendar without that didnt seem different enough to justify extra install
3,cant complete events must keep dismissing it or delete it
4,the app is great but the complete task list is showing on widget i need only for 7 days i dont know who can help me
4,i like previous version more much handy
4,add a week agenda otherwise a great app i have been using it for years
4,fantastic calendar app lots of of customization options recommended unfortunately the widget i set is not holding and i have to keep selecting the specific widget i want again and again has been this way for the last few updates please fix
4,suddenly again it has happened before the widget is empty i keep refreshing but the entries vanish now this app has been working properly for months so i am happy with it
4,i love this app  have used the pro version for years my only complaint is that i have a pt job that works in 24 h shifts 7a to 7a and theres no way to stop it from showing up on both days
4,برنامه باگ the bug is popping up all at once
4,ive been using this app since the business calendar v1 app i love that i can link to my google calendar and google to do items from the calendar
4,get new promotion to be pro shortterm but app doesnt tell how long for this promotion
4,very helpful 
4,like its clarity variety of colors
4,good working app
4,i am a huge fan of fantastical on ios so i needed an app like it when i got an android phone i love the widget and i love the reminders feature my only critique is i wish there was a simpler view for the monthly view its a little overwhelming to see it all the way it is right now i like fantasticals monthly view better
4,generally great tool nicely integrated different calendars
4,perfect  has all the features that i need took out 1 star because i cant seem to add google meet video to my meetings
4,very easy to use much better than googles calendar app in my opinion
4,great app so far
4,its pretty good aye
4,i cant create new calender  connection failed please check internet connection
4,good but ads for over a minute
4,okay im sold this app has no equal in the play store and has all the features i always wished for there are only two things im missing option to remove the favourite bar i dont need it at all so it just takes up valuable screen real estate and an option to change the text colour for the dark theme its just too dark it should be white not grey
4,it will be perfect if could add a button to go back to today on widget
4,i like this app a lot but still having trouble syncing the app to my phone and my husbands phone
4,solid
4,this is a fantastic app i paid for the pro version after trying for a few weeks the features are just about right for me i switched from another paid app that ive been using for over 10 years 4 stars because 1 colors set manually for eventstasks do not carry across devices 2 minimum task synch time you can set is one hour
4,love it  wanted an app to combine apts  tasks from google with good widgets  does that  more
4,its really good would get 5th star if it was possible to refresh the widget at set intervals also manual refresh of the widget doesnt work have to open the app to sync
4,it would be greater if it can show also google reminders integrated
4,its perfect to me except that the postpone button looks exactly like the refresh button this leads to a lot a lot of confusion maybe just replace the postpone icon with a straight arrow
4,works well for me
4,keep it up
4,perfect except for 1 thing the app is great for syncing and task organization etc except for a persistent reminder option some apps like bz pro have the option where you can click on the reminder in the status bar to read it or accidentally touch it but the reminder wont disappear from the status bar until the user pushes a button to actively dismiss it there is an ongoing notification on this app but the upper limit is only 2 hours after a timed task it would be 5 stars but for this
4,works very well easypracticalvery good game ads do pop upits ok
4,so far no issues with the app
4,this is am amazing ap id give it 5 stars but cant start week on a monday
4,i wish the week numbers could be shown
4,good reliable mostly easy to use could do with a little more thought on how to enter an appointment quickly too many steps to do it
4,good app but too much ads lately
4,helpful and useful however the app has a glaring feature omission it lacks the capability to create an event with multiple reminders thats the reason why i didnt give the app five stars
4,best of the rest and ive tried most all of them simple yet elegant interface with lots of customization options update its been nearly two years and i still think this is the best calendar app for me
4,good experience
4,confirming my previous 4star rating on the whole excellent can be confusing in some views but that only needs some familiarity to cope with
4,so so close to perfect  just not quite it needs three things to get five stars from me 1 tasks should be sortable by multiple criteria so that i can order them by date and then by priority for instance 2 tasks should be nestable with subsubsubsubetc tasks 3 it should not need access to google calendar if there is a local calendar  it should be optional not mandatory the rest of you stop whining about the free version  if you want to complain buy it first
4,i really like this app but it has some weird issues set as a widget itll list multiple events on the same day example 3 or 4 entries as independence day  no way to delete them not linked to multiaccounts shows all no matter what very frustrating other than that its good for quick calendar entries thats why its staying edit going to settings  appearance  filter duplicate events gets rid of them just dont have muliltiple exact same entries on the same date 4 now
4,its the best calendar
4,was a great great app  super functional  up until recently when the events added to the phone no longer sync with the exchange account  customer services reached and helped much appreciated
4,good ads are very annoying might delete due to ads why pay when i can get it accomplished without the ads
4,awesomeness
4,good calendar app
4,works reasonably well but has some integration issues with office 365 and outlook also not a big fan of the format but its definitely better than the builtin apps worth anything from microsoft
4,amazing calendar both the light and dark colour version are good just one suggestion the sync has to be more fast with other calendars sometimes the sync is little sloppy that can be a easy fix thumbs up
4,very good but i just wish it was easier to copy an event
4,ive had this app on my phone for many years but lately it has been getting worser and worser my main issue is that changes in events especially recurring events do not synchronize and i have missed deadlines because of this its no longer trust worthy google calendar works find so until this synchronization issue is fixed im back to using google calendar update 24082020 synchronisation of changed recurring events seems to be beter today fingers crossed ive updated my rating
4,works well updates and time changes are sometimes tricky
4,best calendar ive found more options for display and inserting content would make it perfect
4,is a great appbut it will be more if some imocon can be added
4,good program i do not like the fact that months scroll up and down this causes some confusion
4,please add delete option in notification
4,been using this for years i am still trying to figure out how to import my work google calendar
4,seems to be a pretty good app for me so far have used this app for a good couple years now no problems and i use this instead of the one that was installed on my phone samsung galaxy s7 update aug2020 still loving this app still working good keeps my reminders i set for bill payments and also drs apts etc helps keep me on top of everything i highly recomend this app for your phone it also has options for upgrading if you want its great 
4,exceeeelllaaaannntt
4,works fine
4,great way to maintain appointments
4,adverts are very annoying and totally irrelevant for me
4,really cool but ui could be upgraded to look more sleek and its actually quite slow but maybe thats because of mh older phone model
4,you have to adapt to it but it getting better
4,helpful and useful application it is a pity too much options are in the paid version
4,satisfied best app to use for multiple calendars i could easily control which calendar i would like to see especially during vacations office calendar stays hidden
4,great calendar would recommend
4,where can i turn off ampm time format here where i live 24 hours format is used and all that ampm stuff irritates too much i havent found this option in settings in previous versions was 24 hours format
4,useful app runs smoothly able to sync to multiple calendars invite participants set recurrent events notifications setting maybe a bit buggy was unable to turn off the notifications in my email
4,pls make agenda scrolling in the widget possible again galaxy s7  cm launcher 
4,keeps pushing me to rate the app even though i already have and gave you 5 stars loses a star
4,runs smoothly with all my mailing programs at a time outlook gmail roundcube maybe a little design update needed but the best mailing app i have used so far an integration of google maps for addresses of meetings in the premium version at least would be nice
4,better reminder system is needed setting do not seem to stick
4,ive had this app for many years as it used to be the best its had some difficulties the past couple but they are improving again
4,update still like the app but now there are annoying timed ads stuck in after saving or editing so i am taking off 1 star very customizable including the widget i can make it whatever size i want and show me what is coming up at a glance
4,needs a backup system
4,wish it woud sync better to audio all calenders that i have in google
4,very useful clearly laid out update in 2020 excellent app
4,sometimes doesnt synch over devices
4,the calendar should be able to set up recurring events easier updated the calendar still makes it difficult to define a recurring date that occurs on the 3rd monday 1st thursday etc it should be more intuitive also it should allow you to define the event type better instead of just birthdays anniversaries etc a custom event type that is user defined would be nice like job anniversary named day national bbq day etc how do you import a list of holidays from a file htmltxtxml 
4,the most feature rich highly customizable calendar offered today however i wish i could add non holiday events like mothers day fathers day valentines day etc
4,great app with regular updates
4,integrates nicely with all calendars
4,much better calendar then the one that came with the phone
4,the best ever only bug when ur restart ur mobile
4,just paid for this app latest update ive lost some events in 1 of the 4 google calendars i view those events show up just fine in the google calendar and used to show up ok my free business calendar i see you did an update july 20 maybe there is a bug in that version i tried stopping the app cleared cache cleared all data started over still missing some events in one calendar refreshresync doesnt help all events showing in google calendar shut down restarted phone not fixed
4,sometimes widgets dont update themselves and stay the same day
4,great app pulls together lots of info that keeps me intheknow and sane
4,i really like this calendar it syncs well with my google accounts  better than other 3rd party calendar apps ive tried ive only used the free version
4,one of the few android apps ive been happy to pay for and never regretted doing so
4,i like that it keeps more than a years worth of data for the most part it is easy to use the main complaint is having to struggle past ads fairly often the good thing is that they dont last long ads are always irritating it never used to lock the screen with ads
4, good
4,it has been working well with the exception of syncing i have to manually do that once a or more
4,i like this app hope you habe this on ios
4,bought the pro version and it does the job only improvement i would suggest is an indicator showing how long a timed profile has before changing also what it will change to
4,i would appreciate have notification alerts in my lock screen android 10 
4,very good app the synchronization with outlook is not always happening somehow but it is generally very reliable
4,great without the ads
4,ive been using this app for about 2 years i like the way you can customize so many aspects if you want but it is simple to use out of the box i use the widget almost exclusively
4,i love this app but have one major disappointment  when i input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day it doesnt show a solid bar of colour from day 1last day usually at least the first or last day or both show up as a separate event it is very annoying and confusing
4,really good calendar app i like that they have now added a larger range of colours they took away a feature i used and i dont use everything available but its easy to use and im keeping it 
4,still enjoying this calendar app but would like it better if it was a little more intuitive 
4,not a big user but my use is very satisfactory
4,the only problem i have is i really really miss the popup reminders hopefully that will be brought back but still by far the best calendar app ive tried i used the original business calendar since it was first released many years ago
4,people
4,simply the best business calendar i have use for ordinary and very busy people
4,ive been using the pro version for ages but its been very disappointing with the function to make edits to an individual event that ive created as part of a recurring series taken away if i want to edit it just to cancel or change the time for that 1 event im given only 2 options you can either change that particular event as well as all future events in that series or all events in the series its frustrating and time consuming to deletecreate the series again for just that 1 edit
4,the month popup in weekly view doesnt work not sure why otherwise id give it 5
4,sangat membantu untuk mengingatkan acara2 penting
4,top of my wish list is ability to copy and paste events other than that great app
4,so many features and options does not support google calendar reminders
4,great app i cant live without just wish they would apply the html code in tasks so that i can write in bold italic etc and i can drag appointments around in agenda view of the calendar good work guys keep it up
4,extremely smooth start and sync including reverse sync from app to calendar
4,easy to see event on gadget
4,very handy 
4,having problems the app is not syncing anymore with my google calendar i doublechecked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync still no good it is set to auto sync every 3 hours edit changed from 3 to 4 stars i appreciate the suggestion to try and help it didnt fix the issue however with my new phone the app is working seamlessly very easy to use lots of customization visually easy to read thanks
4,does exactly what it is needed for
4,works really well
4,incredible the best app of organization
4,only complaint is the ads werent there till 2020
4,ive been using it for a couple of years  its worked well for me i like being able to set reminders on tasks something gtasks doesnt do by itself i did spring for the paid version since i use it pretty heavily and to get the allinone widget worth it
4,very good app helps me keep organized and does not let me forget anything also syncs with the google account so i dont miss any dates i would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly to achieve milestones and to track them this app would become exceptional and dependable thank you i know you will ponder my suggestion 
4,very useful easy to plan daily schedule please keep on improving
4,love it im self employed with several appointments a day being able to see my appointments at a quick glance is really helpful and a must for me
4,this is the best calenders and task combination ive found so far i very much like the feature that allows multiple reminders syncing with google calendar is still in development even though both allow tasks subtasks and reminders the syncing is not yet perfected it would be great to see this done
4,good app lets you to add yearview which is unavailable in google calendar i am using it for four years
4,i would have given 5 stars if it was possible to sort tasks manually i have been waiting for this feature for so long other than that you really have tons of useful features 
4,exactly what l need and what l have been looking for very easy to use zimbabwe
4,early i was able to register birth date in birth day reminder and it reminded on the day with the age as mr satish age 55 that feature is missing
4,still using this app every day some of the best with frequent updates kudos to the developers
4,much easier to read than google calendar
4,i like how it works though one massive thing i cant either figure out how to do which is more likely the case or you just dont have a repeat of the same event without having scheduled it 6 separate times in one day like eat 6 times a day supplements 8 times i think you get it other then that its perfect for work quick and easy for me to keep my clients in there own lane and me on time
4,lowered to 4 stars because still can not use caldav to sync tasks so they are only on the phone dont break the phone or you can use google tasks if thats enough for you otherwise its very good im moving away from google and this does do calendars via caldav use davx5 to sync
4,cannot get any of the other calendars to show up other than my gmail calendar theyre listed in the settings ive got them checked but nothing shows up on the main screen
4,displaying the contacts calendar of every google account cannot be deactivated in calendar  tasks list it reactivates immediately
4,i have a built in calendar in my phone which i use for personal use then i downloaded this app which i wanna use for business purposes but whenever i add an event it will linked to my personal calendar how can i separate the event only in my business calendar i dont wanna mix all together
4,great app the only thing i miss is syncing tasks with other accounts than google like caldav
4,my go to calendar
4,hi when will it be integrated with the dark mode setting on your phone
4,ive been using the paid version for several years now the calendar is well designed and i enjoyed everything it can offer recently though there are sync issues with my google calendar i sometimes have to do it manually
4,one or two interface aspects i might wish to adjust would like event status to be reflected in its display would like events to reflect their eventtype category
4,i like its efficiency leaves me with a sense of confidence that once entered will remind me when it should completely satisfied
4,great for keeping track of events and appointments
4,helpful although or right because i am still the kind of fountain pen letter writer
4,best i could find for my needs
4,i really like using buisness calendar whats missing for me is a windows version with an option to sync between phone and pc
4,bought the paid version and this was working exceptionally well until recently my gmail entries now only appear for the last two years or so and not beyond the google calendar shows them all so not sure why its not synching fully
4,there is a lot of good in this app but i want to mention places that need improvement there needs to be a setting for how often the app syncs with your calendars also if you change a meeting time in outlook it doesnt seem to update in business calendar
4,nice interface simple to use good widget
4,nice app although the full screen ads are pretty annoying
4,i was using this app for years and im used to it but those ads are so annoying its sad for me to look for other options you should leave those ads out
4,very helpful and reliable
4,i like this app a lot
4,pretty good calendar app i like the layout of the samsung calendar app a little better but this one has more features
4,great calendar although the long and often advertisements get a little much though
4,did what i wanted it to and i paid for the pro version because it was pretty easy to use and i think developers deserve the support  only gave 45 stars because its not very aesthetically pleasing its plain and i wish they had more options for themes colours ans fonts
4,really like this but how do i take off the holidays i have gone to all settings cant find how
4,much easier to view than most 
4,works well but wish i could delete public holidays that are not relevant for me
4,calendar shares well but drops previous dates too quickly
4,easy and quick to update
4,what happened to the setting for choosing how far in the future to sync calendars the app on my phone is only showing events for 1 month in the future and then the calendar is blank there are many events much further out than this that i can no longer see on the app ive been through the entire menu tree and no longer see the setting for length of time to sync
4,like the app purchased it keep it up
4,very pleased with the interface and overall functional capabilities of the app
4,the best calendar application the only improvement area is quick sync it doesnt sync as quickly as google calendar
4,works well but is not perfect
4,have used for several years now and have been very happy with it
4,very user friendly im not very techie but this is easy
5,good deal and good function

5,excellent for business meeting

5,does what it says  reminds you even after the programmed time for some reason i dont understand

5,this is a great calender thats easy to customize and integrate with everything in your life
5,gives me exactly what i need to manage my busy life
5,i love this app helps keep me and my 23 color coded google calenders organized
5,cracking product
5,really great app manages all my calendars easy to use
5,update 2020 still an amazing calendar app
5,i bought this app some years ago and stopped using it because it was not compatible with my work exchange account productivity was way down because of using a multiplicity and some really bad apps now it supports it and i am using it again and i love it every bit as when i left it thanks so much for this app i got an issue with the hide calendars bar though it shows entries but i cannot delete entries from the menus
5,no complaints  works as advertised
5,swell
5,best calendar app ever 4 years later and its only improves excellent developers who are responsive to feedback id pay for it again its that good

5,amazing app and real value for money
5,excellent product
5,no problesgood experience with this calendar so far
5,i like it so i bought the ad free
5,used it for quite a few years decent app always room for improvement but it works well
5,一目了然顏色也夠多確實把行程分門別類出來只有每天早上第一次使用時有廣告後面都沒有廣告非常實用用幾年了
5,my every day reference fantastic
5,my far
5,best calendar app out there super reliable and has all the features you will ever need
5,works very well easy interface great features
5,i have used this cal and predecessor for many years with many accounts and i like its flexibility description history geo history colours and look and feel flexibility it is very well made i use a full size panel on one page of the phone and it shows me everything good grip on what i am doing and planning
5,excellent loads of features  tried lots this is the one
5,great app lots of updates
5,excellent features very clean design i especially like the task management and birthday age features
5,this is one of my favourite app on phone widget is on main page full size i would like if it has reminder integrated or alarm sound connected with tasks sometimes notification is not strong or bored enough to remind me on an eventtask
5,well done a spiffing app try this if events dissapear here are the steps i followed 1 swich on airplane mode 2 clear calendar app storage  cache  settings  apps  calendar  storage  clear storage 3 clear calendar storage at system level  settings  apps  see all  menu  show system    calendar storage  storage  clear storage 4 open calendarverify that all events are gone 5 swich off airplane mode 6 start calendar everything should sync after a few minutes
5,great app with plenty of features ive used it for several years and never had any issues highly recommend
5,its a calendar app the job is pretty straightforward but it does it very well quickly and in a nice interface specific items syncing with tasks is great syncing with other todo apps like ticktick would be dreamy but thats asking a bit much being able to set defaults for making new events is good the color scheme is nice and not all blinding shades like many apps and i love how customizable it is i havent used event groups but it looks like a great feature tldr great app
5,very helpful app
5,great app steps up phone calendar with colors and features
5,excellent simple as that however it does have a big problem still it only takes 3 simultaneous events to make 1 or more of the events disappear from view you can reveal the missing one by hiding non essential calendars otherwise excellent really appreciate the ability to set multiple alerts for an event eg 1 week ahead 2 days ahead and day before
5,i bought the full version purely because the devs put so much effort at delivering such a great product that i felt an urge obligation of expressing my gratitude i truly deeply thank you guys for such an outstanding app
5,every updates is great i dont use all the features but the updates only improve the stuff i use never had a problem with updates great app
5,ever in love with business calendar 2 its configuration settings are of sublime finesse for example you can move events in 5 minute increments or even 1 minute increments its especially useful when moving events as its better than other options do on both desktop and mobile applications would utmost recommend to those seek a powercalendar app
5,great calender
5,just works perfect 
5,fantastic reliable app keeps everything organized
5,ive had this app for a few years now and i love it i use it everyday and prefer it over anything ive used in the past
5,this is the best calendar ive found with emojis it is very useful for my teaching schedule
5,excellent calendar i have already suggested to developers to provide the calendar events ms excel format also
5,great app and was happy to support by purchasing premium the way the tasks work are better than any other app ive seen
5,please add tasker compatibility android 10 has crippled this apps effectiveness and tasker can solve this plus add unlimited customization options popups are a must have feature
5,have been using this for years wipes the floor with the standard google calendar app in terms of usability and functionality but also syncs perfectly with my google calendar it has by far the best and most customisable widget of any calendar app i tried which was what drew me to it in the first place
5,the best i ever used
5,welltill now ive used it for a quite a while experimented played with features and have found it very functional intuitive and quite simple to master as you go it has allowed me to integrate two different calendars and scheduler to a point i can see separately each two or all three at the same time very convenient as ive learned with a touch i can see either of my two calendars both at the same times i can isolate my to dos i can isolate to see just holidays or see all
5,have been using this app for 2 years very reliable and is as feature rich as you need it to be highly recommended for someone who lives and dies by a schedule
5,lots of great info in one spot
5,still the best ive tested many calendars and this one has the best layout ive seen
5,excellent calendar i use it everyday i used to use the free version which works fine but after realizing how much i depend on this app for everything i bought the full version full version has many nice options overall really usefull calendar can invite others to events has tasks birthdays many colours and icons to choose from for my fellow organizer geeks a
5,best calendar app
5,great get it
5,exceptional flawless absolutely has to be the best calendar out there have been using and enjoying for 7 years or so buy the pro version you will love it
5,using it everyday obviously  super stable
5,my best calendar app it has everything i need the only missing thing is the split view month and eventstasks list
5,i like it i can use it for all my accounts that manage calendars and also filter them very easily if i didnt know it i would like someone recommended it to me _
5,awesome app fullfil all of the requirements some small features if added 1 make overdue task have separate color in widget to differentiate from today task 2 there should be an option to make task from subtask only no need to have father task
5,the best calendar period
5,102020 still using both phone and pc versions syncs enough to be useful but still a bit buggy problem is that there isnt anything better that i can find still does the job old review like that it syncs with pc calendar like the color and holidaybirthday options dont like that birthdays dont sync from phone to pc had problems with syncing at all until unchecked calendar on pc version
5,ive been using this calendar app for years havent found any other user interface that comes close
5,i have used the app for many years and i really like it i tried a few other app but i always came back to business calendar great app bc i just do
5,great calendar
5,great app have been using it for a few years now with no major issues except that sometimes it misses some appointments when syncing external calendars from google anyway to fix it thanks
5,i have been using this app for years they have personalized tech support very responsive it works with all of my google calendars from multiple accounts and lets me see everything at once it creates templates so i dont have to work so hard to reenter information love this app
5,happy user of many years i use it to keep my day on track
5,sync issues heres how to fix it on samsung galaxy products tablets phonesetc you will need both google calendar app and samsung calendar check both of these to make sure they are syncing google calendar and samsung calendar will over ride business calendar but it appears data is taken from samsung calendar for bc2 pro and samsung calendar takes data from google calendar so make sure all are syncedlol ya its a lot of work  sometimes they are functioning fine but this will help you if they dont cooperate dont be upset with the developers of bc2 pro they dont have a say in the matter as these big companies have big egos and bc2 pro cant do much about itexcept this  bc2 pro  if you are reading this  please create your own calendar system to sync accross platforms so we dont have to rely on google calendar and samsung lets just stay within the bc2 platform i will happily ditch google calendar forever if you make this happen you guys rock cheers
5,great app the widget keeps me in check with all appointments
5,great app this is the only app i use or need
5,simply the best 
5,does precisely what it is supposed to do
5,never had a single issue or complaint does what it says on the tin
5,very handy
5,used this for 5 years i love it
5,i wish this app had an option to move the line dividing each day above the date below the last event listed not below the date it can be confusing to determine if the line is separating the events for the specific date or for a date in the future
5,even with adds great dependable east to use calendar
5,i would be lost without it
5,great app the free version offers all the features i need and more integration with google calendars is seemless and i rarely have issues with the app im not a fan of the new ad format but i admit it was short sighted of me to initially give a 3 star rating because of that i am changing it now to 5 stars because this is still by far the best calendar app ive used
5,this app is wonderful and an integral part of my phone and my day
5,excellent calendar translation with good functional widgets recommended
5,love this calendar ease of use to add move and delete appointments different colours linking accounts love it so much that after a year i moved to the paid version i would love to see fun backgrounds though cheers
5,been using for several years great app
5,guys the sync with google keeps failing recently whats wrong
5,easy and clear
5,update on 2016 review  bc still works best have pro version  well worth it love the week view which allows you to see everything  a must for my appointment driven life other calendar apps tried didnt do the week as cleanly or at all happy user
5,this app is the one that is completely necessary to keep things in order
5,best calendar app for android agenda widget is simply must have
5,tried various calendars needed one with google task support this was the only one i found that did this reliably easy to use
5,i was looking for a calendar app to use with my new pixel 4a and now i have found it two thumbs up
5,the best calendar app
5,perfect and support replies quick
5,the widgets have made it so much easier for me to stay organized and i appreciate the level of customization as well very useful and one of the best calendar apps ive used
5,definitely worth the money easy to use intuitive multifunctional and surprisingly versatile
5,terrific
5,im one of those people who needs as many settings as you can possibly squeeze in one app and im happy thank you so much
5,i used to miss appointments with the phone app even though i am still adjusting to 3g business calendar i am satisfied with it it will continue to get better for me thanks
5,great app  so great it is actually the first one and only one so far i bought  i love the clear thoroughly customizable interface and the widget on android is super practical i have 1 small complain though when i set new events they often tend to start at xx05 rarely on the exact time xx00 any fix 
5,5star product undoubtedly and unconditionally one of the finest apps of the store imo
5,top product using it for years now so customisable love it
5,very flexible does what is supposed to
5,i have tried every calendar app and this one is by far my favorite i recommend it to all of my friends easy to use i love the template feature that i can have many different calendars and favorite calendars and that it syncs google calendar
5,good what else i can say спасибо gracias 20201050528
5,im so impressed i had to write this i have never used such a comprehensive calendar in my life and im old i never write reviews as i really feel its a waste of time well this time i am willing to waste my time to say this is a simply amazing app and i have ran businesses for 25 years and have come across a lot of software thanks guys ps buying the pro when i get home today not because i need it but i do think i owe it to you thanks keith
5,i really like the task lists function it helps me organize the tasks for my work and personal projects separately so it only gets as cluttered as i want it to look at one time lol
5,my chaotic life revolves around my schedule this app is perfect for organizing the choas
5,great job
5,beautiful best ever calendar app which satisfy my needs even free version is great
5,excellent calendar five stars
5,still is the best calendar i have been using this for at least 8 years now it is the best calendar apps bar none what more can i say
5,its a calendar and it works really im not too picky except for camera gear good quality lenses will make or break you never use the plastic kit lenses for professional purposes lighting is also a major factor in images
5,superb calander app i have found so far
5,adding a picture  to an event is worth a 1000 words bc2 can do it
5,excellent  thank you well dedicated work
5,excellent clean calendar app
5,ive been using this app for 4 years now its the best but the interface is a bit tired id like to see more gesture support like the samsung or google calendar but its still the best
5,te amo dont re ftyxx up they were c f de leon if
5,fantastic calendar so much better than the samsung calendar that came with my note 10
5,this app has absolutely increased my productivity i use it everyday
5,after 7 years of using business calendar it no longer allows me to insert new events is there a problem please advise
5,me like but one thing i dont like is if you schedule something over a couple of days if you block out 8 hours in a day the entire day looks occupied but if you block out several days its just a little sliver along the top of the day entry that makes no sense to me i want the entire day to look blocked out
5,great app for organizing schedual
5,love this app easy to use integrates seamlessly
5,does everything i need to do with a calendar
5,very good all around
5,a very userfriendly calender app has the right features would recommend it to others
5,i dont care for the calendar app since google calendar is superior however i use this app for the widget which can be customized to be simplistic
5,been using it for years for my caldav calendar on owncloud works great
5,negative increase of ads everywhere good this calender allowed me to organize my day in a clutterfree manner i was specifically looking for 1 feature i needed to be able to categorize or tag each event and then be able to toggle them on and off as needed so i can turn off all birthdays or repeating events or work items or whatever or only see that item this app allows you to categorize each event as needed its a bit tedious to update all of your events but later its simple
5,use this app every day  have no had any problems
5,very helpful app  now i can manage all of my day tasks from my mobile  it help you to remember all of your tasks  thanks for this app  i tried to go premium  but some error appears on the screen  please help me to go premium 
5,it is profound very flexible  easy to use dependable app yet still needs improvement particularly calenders should be more flexible and user friendly
5,great tool to stay organized
5,updating my review to 5 star since i was able to get back my pro access
5,love this app keeps all my appointments straight couldnt function without it
5,solid calendar alternative and better with play pass
5,perfect for my daily routine
5,easily the best and most customizable app of its kind pro version well worth the money highly recommend
5,the best calendar and task app ever i used it for many years now it has a lot of features and customizations and it is still easy and intuitive to use they keep adding new features and improvements all the time
5,i bought the pro version years ago now have consistently used it across various galaxy s series devices if ppl having issues u need to dwnld google calendar set calendars  accts etc through it sync then set calendars in settings  sync bc2 turn off google cal notifications so u dont get 2  allow bckgrnddont optimize in bc2 these are all android 9 os if you use any battery saving setting on your device really this is the most stable  consistent app ever backup settings to drive
5,i love this calendar it is so easy to see different categoriestypes of appointments very useful
5,update 5 still note20 ultra update 5 again note8 now long time user here on galaxy note4 now love the new design but hate that i cannot fully trust it anymore especially with templates which used to be a big plus for v10 specifically on several occasions and more than 1 template its not a settings fault it will assign a random date to the event  for once but not always it seemed to be the date when the template was created will updateupgrade stars when this is fixed
5,i love this application so much i can organize so much easier without having to pay i love it
5,great accurate day date
5,great calendar use this for work and personal business had everything i need and more i use my calendar a ton for work and this app makes planning easier for me
1,premium for dark mode no thanks ill pass
1,so you just put tasks in alphabetical order instead of the order in which i need to do them depending on the time there should be the capability to change that i do not want to read my tasks in alphabetical order i want to read them in the order that i placed them on my task list im uninstalling this app i dont know why i keep trying to use it it never works well
1,i subscribed for a year plan and its asking me to get a premium i mean i paid but cant use the premium feature and its not even letting me log out trash bug

1,lousy app
1,i loaded the app on to my amazon fire it will only display horizontally and i dont have the export option even though i have the premium subscription i cant export my task list either
1,in order to actually use the app as a planner you have to pay money very misleading and dissapointing
1,i use to love this app it is the perfect organizer with great features however for the last month it barely opens i am lucky if it will actually open twice a day the app will say not responding opens to a black page or doesnt do anything but freeze my phone momentarily my life is saved into this app so i am so frustrated
1,would not let me create a log in
1,this app is not worth the 6 a year poorly developed with several glitches
1,1 star for obligatory signup using google fbtwitter
1,doesnt work offline requires internet and information so not personal as it is over the internet sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up uninstalled
1,i couldnt even log in
1,nopeall i ever wanted was to keep track of my stuff durring winter breakand no im an eight year oldand i have to enter an emailplease god no god save this app
1,cant sign in and there are reviews from october saying the same so no improvement over months of having the same issue
1,so disappointing i used to love this app bit over the last few months it is sooooooo glitchy i just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime i think im done they show back up in triplicate everything i changed is still there after an hour does that sound like a good time management program and no way to contact support because when i try to get to the menu it shows a black screen
1,trash dont waste ur time unless u want to pay for the things that should b free
1,i dont care for the dashboard
1,couldnt even create a log in
1,piece of poo
1,note to self the demo version of this app is totally useless  so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs before paying for the premium version ill find another way to get my needs met im sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things since im not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles  i am passing this app over no thanks uninstalling
1,completed tasks continue to reappear
1,lmao this app is so bad setting events is a pain time zones dont work the from time and to time of an event dont work if you trust this app for your planning im sure youd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting just use microsoft outlook etc and pay for it this one is a waste of time
1,it wont allow you to create an account with email address and password why give you the option but then doesnt work when you use it if not resolved within a week uninstalling app
1,got a new phone and app now wont allow me to hit sign in button customer service is very slow to respond to help love the app for last 2  3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my  paid for it  to think it just renewed
1,why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without give me a break you filthy parasites
1,closing and crashing when adding tasks and project support answering but doesnt help
1,not as advertised
1,too complicated when putting on data ill stay with my diary
1,closes everytime i try to add a note event or anything else since last update
1,this is just a reskinned samsung calendar dont waste your time
1,the app does not work after last nights update
1,app has stopped opening
1,suddenly not displaying all other calendars and after reinstalling app wont open
1,wouldnt let me make an regular account without linking something to it
1,well i just got it and attempted tocreate an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it what gives
1,could be better pls fix the repeat setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time for example i have to study during mondays tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm the app isnt very specific about it deeming it useless to me hoping for a better update
1,over basic definitely not worth 200 per year pictures shown are not what the app looks like
1,was great at first but a new bug makes it so that every time i unlock my phone i have to press the home button twice to be able to use my phone at all i know that it is this app causing the problem as when i click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs this app is always the only one shown i will have to uninstall now because of this
1,the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app
1,i have used this app for years i have always paid for the premium version at first it was my favorite app but it has gotten steadily worse now it is very glitchy it closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when im trying to set an appointment with a customer it also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule the developers are uncaring and blame my phone note 8 im looking for a new app
1,doesnt update changes live or correctly even was a waste of money for some basic app
1,took  before the renewal date have not recieved my refund and canceled on the due date
1,purchased the plus version and now with the update to pro i no longer have my premium features
1,will not be using ever again
1,i cannot even create an account i fill in whats needed and im pressing the button and its not working some1 help
1,i loved this app but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with ill keep this at a 1 i did previously have this as 5 star but i cant stand companies doing stuff like this
1,not great
1,this is a great planner but im really annoyed that having previously paid for the pro version i am now expected to pay an annual fee
1,i liked this app even paid for it but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior i see two other reviews here with a similar problem the app will periodically launch itself but its just a black screen and it creates a copy of my home screen  looks the same but frozen until i hit the close button then the copy scrolls away and i can again use my phone just odd
1,i have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone i would have to hit the open apps and close it before i could do anything with my phone i have emailed and explained what it was doing and i get am email wanting more explanation so i did several days later i get an email that wants a video showing i dont think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew
1,annoyed paid for this years ago paid full version and used it and recommended it now i am asked to pay yearly to remove ads what joke i paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase
1,this app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen that is extremely suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling
1,infoo
1,i cant get new password it sends message email is not available
1,its simple enough to set up a task or eventbut not once has it reminded me as set to so looking for one that will
1,when opening a subtask from any view the subtask window does not even show the main listtask it is from
1,cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts dumb
1,this app used to be great now it is garbage a few months ago it started doubling a few tasks  no problem i just delete the extras now i get 5 to 10 copies of every task i delete it is worthless   i cant forget the wait times to open the app up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen   oh and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though i have been using the paid version for years already   i let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response
1,cannot log in on other devices
1,i received a notice from planner pro this morning when i went to schedule some appts it notifies me i cannot use the app until payment received ii checked my bank and payment was made on 01262019 i will be cancelling as unable to use
1,wont even let me make a new account unusable
1,cant get account created tried linking facebook and straight account creation will not let me progress past sign in page
1,could not get the app to save event time properly all i wanted was to put a due date between 1150 pm and 1159 pm on a certain day would not do it the app kept automatically changing my times thats annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on
1,amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself
1,i hate it
1,i thought upgrading and paying the 8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app it does not i havent been able to sync any of my devices  absolutely will not let me add an event this was a waste of time and money if i cant add my schedule on my lap top version then theres no point to this app plus theres no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back 
1,uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current google calendar
1,shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time
1,uninstalled it interferes with my normal google calendar
1,want use only not sharing
1,this app deleted my whole google calender
1,dont bother with this planner app there are lots of other apps that do the same thing this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using seriously dont even bother with this bs
1,who puts ads on a calendar yall that desperate for money smh
1,does not integrate well across multiple crossplatform devices more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app
1,this app sucks if you dont have the pro version i only had for a few min and couldnt do more than add a task i tried to add an event and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldnt let me
1,infested with ads now downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time i open it
1,i lost all of my notes and it wouldnt accept my passcode to get in any more so i deleted it and installed it again then logged in and all of my stuff was gone please help i need it back
1,app became unusable with 110618 update now the app takes 3045 to open up after i click it and then im get an annoying ad that plays that i cant close for another 510 seconds ill be finding a new calendar app
1,please fixed it why i cant login my passcode damnly alot of doc i ve save inside
1,i have been using this for more than a year now it was great this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered pls fix this issue thanks
1,cannot access the app
1,i tried adding the pro for 799 because i thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesnt do that or any of the things i was hoping for i have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund i have sent emails asking for help and havent received anything back so i just want my money back and this app gone
1,will not accept passcode after todays update have been a paid user for some time and need my info back please fix and i will update my review useless to me until resolved
1,no
1,it says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie
1,this basically is just a purple version of google calendar it has the almost exact same layout as google calendar without any extra features i wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with google dont bother getting this app just use calendar directly
1,i liked it at first even paid for it too but now it wont sync across my devices so i need to find something else that will
1,absolutely terrible customer service they refused after several years to fix the 97 tablet aspect ratio for a paying customer this is absolutely poor customer service has never work properly once dont buy those that run away
1,could not even create a account
1,a negative experience  i wasnt using it and forgot about it until it was renewing  i didnt port it over to a new phone and it seems  you cant cancel the app except through the app  this means i would have to install it on my new phone give it permission to access my information then cancel the subscription and uninstall it  other apps on my phone with subscriptions i can cancel through google play  apparently not this one
1,"started my account with outlook and went to put it on my phone apparently 
forgot password so hit forgot password and it said i didnt have an account 
so i went back to my tablet and it told me the same thing i even put a pin 
in my phone and the pin was right but it had deleted everything all the 
same and told me again i didnt have an account after making another new 
one this app would be great if it didnt delete everything all the time i 
would have recommended it before all this happened but not any more"
1,"you are nutzzz i am not going to pay you yearly for this it is simply not 
worth it"
1,"i set up an account set up tasks for the week now it says my email and 
password are not on file how do i correct this"
1,wants you to buy full version for tasks
1,you have to pay for reminders not worth it
1,"used the trial but it consistently asks for a pin to open it i have no pin 
for it i have installed and uninstalled it multiple times with the same 
result if the free version doesnt work i wont be spending money on a 
full version"
1,absolute trash you cant do anything without paying 799 
1,dates are wrong
1,"it was a bad app it was to challenging and it was so stupid i would not 
recommend it to anyone dont get it it seriously sucks"
1,"why do they need my age uninstalled straight who knows whatever data 
is being harvested"
1,"dont bother unless you pay them799yr they dont offer a 
trialsuspicious and you get no access to features without paying too 
many other apps just like this that are much cheaper and let you try the 
pay version before paying"
1,"i think this is more on the app store side shows download but never 
progresses past that i have a new note 8"
1,"i wanted a calendar app to keep track of business appointments separate 
from my personal appointments however this app automatically synced with 
my other calendar combining all appointments i have reached out to them 
for assistance but recieved no help very disappointed"
1,how do i contact you to get my passcode changed cant get in  website not valid  please help  the app looks like what i want to use but cant get in  my bad but need your help
1,requires too many permissions suspicious also seems to be online only unacceptable
1,it does not work as the ad
1,you shouldnt have to pay to get access for reoccurring events
1,theyve redone the layout and its horrible
1,will not sync calendars
1,i purchased the upgrade subscription and found no meaningful difference between the free application and the subscription application i feel ripped off and immediately ask for the return of my money
1,this used to be my goto planner app but now its so buggy always undoes my settings and turns back on 24 hour format edit a year later and this has only gotten worse where are the supposed bug fixes and doesnt push important task notifications ive set i bought the pro version a while ago when it was a single payment purchase but now apparently i no longer can use it and its a yearly subscription that wasnt a condition when i bought it and i would never have bought it if id known theyd convert to yearly subs not worth it
1,cant set a daily reminder without paying
1,it charges you 5 dollars for the same thing google provides
1,i have used this app for a while but two days ago it lost much of my data and now closes every time i try to use it  i tried to reboot the device but to no avail  i tried to contact support to no avail 
1,i uninstalled immediately  i am looking for a calendar that allows for me to have repeating tasks on the same day of every month  this app does not do this  it only repeats monthly not on the same day of every month  then when you try to change the date for the task it doesnt populate correctly  very disappointing plus the only way to see if this feature was possible was to purchase a subscription
1,all phones come with built in calendars to use this app as anything more than a basic calendar you have to pay 5 i would not consider that a free app as the only part thats free is the part you already have access to
1,you shouldnt have to have an account
1,cant create account
1,not interested in any app that expects me to open an account before i can see anything associated within the app smh
1,it doesnt work at all
1,i keep trying to edit the settings to be on 12 hour format and only include one of my accounts but the settings keep going back to original settings
1,i set up a passcode and now it wont let me in can i bypass this if i cant i will be asking for a refund
1,didnt work ive tried this before and its never worked dont waste your time
1,not usable without purchasing
1,i chose the password route then they kicked me out my own account i hate google play services
1,i purchsed it in order to use projects and subtasks  disappointed to see its just tasks under projects and doesnt really have subtasis at all  how do i cancel my subscription
1,in short the app is just like a phone calendar i dont see the point in installing an app on my phone that my phone already came with would be better if the days we boxed or lengthy sections
1,dont waist your money or time with this app
1,im not paying for it i dont care how good it is
1,looked good until i used it
1,why should i have to sign up for a calendar app and why does it need my contacts info i dont trust apps like this one there are plenty of great free apps that dont require sign up i am uninstalling i recommend time tune instead
1,this is absolutely worthless actually its probably awesome but only if you pay for the full version seriously great marketing yall imply that you get everything for free then come to find out you even have to pay for recurring events how ridiculous is that right not that its that expensive but one its a yearly payment and two whos going to pay for anything they arent sure will work just right not me   developers im being extra generous and giving you two stars because its a good app behind the payment and its only 5 a year but for real recurring events i should not have to pay for that and dont advertise projects or anything  else  we are forced to pay for with free features
1,used this app one day and it wouldnt accept my pin to get in i emailed support and never heard a word from them the app itself seemed decent but support is horrible
1,you cant even look at your schedule in the weekly view without paying their 5yr subscription trash
1,i downloaded this planner app for a secondary use it completely wiped out everything in my phone calendar which is primary
1,theres no point in downloading this app as it just repeats what any basic calendar app does
1,i hate the lay out its really confusing
1,requires access to my contacts not cool
1,installed on galaxy s8 phone cant get the app to unlock screen requires pin  i dont recall setting up a pin none of the pins i use can open the app ive tried uninstall  reboot  reinstall the app but no joy still stuck at the same enter your passcode screen appxy tech support seems unable to solve the problem
1,logged out could not log back in tried a password reset got invalid email tried to recreate account got email already exists
1,i dont like this app because once you sign up you cant delete your account it sucks the support team wont respond to me and its been an hour now i would not recommend this app to anyone dont waste your time
1,wont  sync
1,the description of this app says it supports tasks  but doesnt tell you it only works in the paid version  tasks are the only reason i downloaded and i will not pay for an app when i cant try out a feature first  i feel like this developer has stolen my contact information now  very shady will not use this or any of their other apps  uninstalling with a vengeance  going back to google calendar and google keep and will continue to look for an app that works like those two google apps in an integrated single appor works similar tor microsoft outlook
1,since the last update the app wont load ive lost all my notes and homework for my class  please fix and i will change my review i usually love this app 
1,wont sync as promised did when i first loaded it but not now no good if it doesnt
1,how do i cancel the yearly subscription
1,free to download not free to schedule projects might as well write things down on notebook paper
1,butty
1,i had pretty high hopes for this app but the passcode feature doesnt work you set the passcode close the app the next time you log in with the passcode you get an error stating your password has been changed you then have to sign in with your actual password if you close the app again you get asked for your passcode not your password but your passcode doesnt work anymore that time so you get locked out and have to uninstall the app entirely just to get back into it the passcode option is useless idk how i feel about the rest of the features
1,after paying the 5 i decided i didnt like it and canceled no refundsrip off
1,no reason to have to register before you can use it  dont like my info to spread online for privacy reasons so bc you make people register is why i uninstalled app
1,sucks within 1 minute ugh
1,this app is worthless if you dont buy full version i dont recommend downloading it
1,its a shame that you have a create a profile or give any of your social media account in order to log in
1,i cant do the setting thingy
1,it seems like it just a regular calander unless you pay for the full version
1,wont let me even test the features of the program without the hassle of creating a full account uninstalled
1,pathetic app the date does not change at 12am but it changes at 12pm and the developer doesnt even care to solve the issue worst app which doesnt even serve its purpose
1,to use this app fully the want you to pay there are many that dont so why waste money
1,why do i need to create an account  i already downloaded the damn thing so why does it require an account sign in  uninstalled
1,cant do recurring tasks without paying for it the calendar my phone came with can do more then this one
1,sucks only does what calender does  dont need it
1,had this horrible app for about 3 minutes and deleted it
1,i like the interface a ton more than the google calendar and i would use it of it didnt have so many bugs with sharing calendars it worked briefly and then stopped by the end my events disappeared my settings were all right but it just didnt work for me i need a calendar that i can edit with my employer the help email couldnt help and stopped responding uninstalled too bad i already bought the computer app
1,i havent used this app or been charged in over a year now you guys charged me put my money back on the card now or i will report you to google
1,if you dont allow access to the contacts you cant use the app really no app i repeat no app needs access to contacts to run my contacts are private and none of your business ive denied access on every single app that asks for it and they all run fine you apparently are too persistent for reasons i cant see uninstalled on the spot let me know when you reconsider your requirements
1,the fact that it forces landscape view is completely absurd
1,you must grant permission to access calendars for google account already on the phone or it wont work if i wanted to use that calendar why would i download this app also for week view you have to pay 499year thats outrageous id consider a onetime payment of 499 but thats a bit too steep as well
1,planner pro annual subscriber app has stopped working force closes on any action using widget
1,no at all free should be in payed app section
1,it is so dumb it starts off with the wrong month and you can do barley anything on it
1,with in 2 minutes the pascoe locked me out then didnt recognize my email not bothering to email since i didnt even get a chance to try it yet
1,it was terrible i couldnt even sign up it keeps glitching
1,this app changed the password i had and i dont know what it is what do i do
1,the app glitches a lot its the oddest thing i will be setting an important appointment time for a day in june but it will randomly place my appointment in september i was trying to figure out what day of the week an event want going to be on and i was looking at the september 2017 page but it was showing me dates for october 2017 even though it said september at the top this has happened multiple times and ive missed 2 appointments in the past momth because my dates were not saved in the correct spot or not at all   i do not reccomed this app even if youre desprate
1,make it free
1,i lost all my records because these people quit supporting their app and are impossible to get ahold it does not sync like its supposed to so if you get a new device every record you ever put on this app is gone period
2,paid for this app really thinking there would be more user control and options much better apps for free  friends
2,i paid for the premium so i can get things repeated weekly i tried to put something in to be repeated every week on tuesday it only repeated one week thats it so i have to put it in manually for every tue there should be a way to type in once and then set a repeat so it will auto show every tuesday i feel like i wasted my money now i set repeat to every 7 days it does not work
2,i would say this is nice but you need your email adress and i gave my correct one but it said please enter a valid email adress this is nice and i am not cursing but please remove the fact that we have to place our email adress i know this is not my app or game but im just giving a suggestion tq
2,used the pro version for a couple months as it seemed like a good app randomly deletes and duplicates events and unable to customise when events are recurring if they arent one day after another you have to manually enter them all uninstalled
2,they are always changing something after updates and it isnt always functional like used to be
2,the widget stops working way to much
2,it makes autocopies of tasks when you delete them keep showing them again and again very annoying
2,this new planner pro for which i paid for life is poorer than the previous version i take ages to open does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward very bad
2,i downloaded this app on my photo and it works great but i just downloaded on my tablet for school and even though i used the same account none of my events were there it didnt sync right i tried to restart nothing this app is good just not for multiple devices
2,this app was fine for years and then became extremely laggy it also started duplicating weekly tasks to the point that i would have to delete five or six versions of a task in order to return it to one weekly often the delete or complete options have to be used multiple times on the same task before it actually disappears i have basically stopped using it except as a calendar but its so slow its not even efficient to be used for that
2,great app but it forces you to sign in to something to use it which is garbage you should be able to use this without signing in backup and restore doesnt have to be via online accounts only it can be export to file thing which i preffer 100 of the time
2,nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with google calendar and not cross platform certainly cannot do 15yr
2,suddenly with ads and paid content disappeared synchronization has some issues
2,its useful but it doesnt fully sync the events tasks and notes between devices its a huge inconvenience besides that i still love the app
2,this is literally just another calendar app misleading calling it a planner smh its not even a good calendar if youre hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it
2,its google calendar with different color scheme
2,ver y often the application does not open you sen question and ask what is happening and you get no replied roger j sanchez from miami
2,loved this app until i updated updated it gibberish on every day now it is terrible like this on my phone and tablet how do i fix i depend on this planner
2,not very intuitive i couldnt find a way to switch between week day or month views
2,notifications stopped working then it deleted all my tasks
2,it is doing a strange black screen thing and randomly opens by itself other reviews have mentioned this and i suspect it is making my phone crash my phone is crashing several times a day when i remove the app it stops crashing i hope there is a fix for this it works just fine on my tablet but not my phone its a great app due to its simplicity i switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund
2,it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes
2,please fix the widget it doesnt automatically update the day it always shows yesterdays date constantly having to remove and install widget
2,i think i could really like this app except i upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes it will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search
2,do not pay for upgrade if you upgrade it just messes the app up i have to manually change days every morning now if it werent for that itd be great please fix
2,i was told to install planner pro instead of planner plus which was what i already used in order for my cell phone  ipad to sync i have had at least 5 emails back  forth with the contact person but i still cant get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed i guess i will have to go back to my google calendar i love the planner plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and ipad
2,eh its mediocre and really doesnt do anything your calendar app on your phone doesnt already do i liked using the month widget until it just decided on jan 29 that the month of february no loger existed i tried to look ahead to the month of feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron jan to march the only way to view feb in the widget was to change the date to feb in my phone just went back to my phones calendar app uninstalling
2,after reinstall data not recover while take backup google drive
2,the interface is great and i love it overall however im giving it two stars because it wont synchronize between my samsung phone and ipad despite being the same account information for each i emailed their support like about this and they asked for my login info but i never heard anything back this is a huge inconvenience because i put a lot into the version on my ipad and i dont and wont do it twice for the same application once this is fixed ill happily increase the rating
2,i would love it if my calendar would sync across by devices and my tasks  notes synced its disappointing because i enjoy the simplicity of the format its user friendly but iy doesnt work for me since i cant sync all devices
2,i loved this planner for several years with no issues all of a sudden i cant launch the app or createedit an event without getting a noisy intrusive popup ads i will be looking for a new option possibly even just my stock calendar
2,i have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well i wanted something where i could see trasks and appointments in a daily view this accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format however there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that i no longer want to use this app i think i will start checking on alternate options
2,free version does not allow you to view all your events in the monthly view i only see colored dots that indicate an event is scheduled i would like to see the event names i contacted support but sadly did not get a response
2,pain ya have to create an account to access
2,it sucks
2,"this app sucks its slow and they make you pay to make checklists which is 
ridiculous"
2,ive had this app for a few years and it worked well until the last several months  its gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like forget you checked off tasks as completed and relist them as incomplete between closing and reopening the app  it also had been freezing more and more frequently to the point where that happens at least once a day and now i cant even load certain screens  because of this i will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app
2,"not what i was looking for i saw there was a time it would remind me i 
thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked"
2,"loved ituntil the projects feature was going to cost me a yearly fee 
honestly i wanted to try it and see if it works for me so you lost me when 
you made the features i wanted cost"
2,"wont let me useaccess weekly view unless i pay 799 for the year what a 
crock ill find another app "
2,"i paid for the subscription but can not use the recurring function i tried 
to make a task for monthly use and it does not show up on the other months 
ahead"
2,"this app was amazing when i first started using it now it duplicates tasks 
too much i have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks"
2,i made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week they seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day i cant edit the original repeating ones i can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times this is very annoying this app was a waste of my money i paid for the ability to make repeating tasks im very disappointed
2,was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my android tablet  seems okay on my smart phone  still i will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell
2,uninstalled when i saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data i never will
2,i set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes
2,i just installed this app and its always on landscape view please fix this soon thank you
2,its just a skin for google calendar
2,when my phone is in tablet mode android 7 the app will not display in portrait mode it defaults to landscape mode  pls fix and ill change my review
2,its ok the free version does the same thing your calender does on  your phone
2,with so many free calendar apps out there theres just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it the only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature but you have to pay to use it sure you have the notes feature but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar so i just cant see the point rather than pay for an upgrade to an app thats just hohum the view isnt even very customizable ill be uninstalling
2,i dont want make an account before trying out the app give us a week trial before making us sign up please
2,would like questions answered i email my questions for answers  i give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me this is very disappointing especially when i bought this app very poor for business kevin
2,i have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back they say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first i did email for answers but no one will answer my questions my questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people so this could be a great app but service is terrible which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping
2,didnt get past not being able to use it in portrait mode  i think i should be able to choose whether i need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option i may end up using it this is only the second app that i have tried for organizing by used to be hand  ink written notebooks
2,ads just too many
2,i really wanted to like this app but its just too buggy sometimes i open the app and it doesnt have the icons to switch views also the 12hour formatting is really flawed and the priority scale seems way too complex high medium low should be enough for most people
2,this app is a pretty good one but on my galaxy note it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason  i paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately
2,i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another however i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with i had to do it like 10 times  but still like the app tho i hope that bug will be fixed sooner
2,ui atrocious nothing fits
2,app is very buggy  week view is completely unusable  shows some events twice and some not at all  also it would be nice if there was an option in month view to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually  fix this and youll get 5 stars but without that especially week view the app is useless
2,isnt thanksgiving and christmas considered a holiday am i wrong
2,widget is buggy  a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode the proper app when reopened shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again poor punctuation eg 28 sep  2017  why the space before the comma is not that big a deal but also adds to the app not feeling very pro
2,i like the app but for the past day i havent got any notifications
2,this app is not good if you dont buy the subscription
2,the app worked fine for awhile but all the events i added were simply gone this morning this was a frustrating experience
2,i got locked out of my planner after entering my paascode the app said that the passcode was wrong it was not wrong i suspected a system glitch and contacted the developer on june 17th of this year i havent received any response yet i found my way around this problem by this time i will not renew my subscription anymore i will look for another app developer with a better customer service
2,why this  require this much personal details
2,i cant set my times for events bc theres no ampm option it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thingannoying
2,i paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didnt work properly come to find out that the pro version doesnt have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does but the paid version does color code gaining that feature isnt worth losing the other two i feel robbed
2,it wouldnt let me in
2,doesnt sync reliably and thats one of the most critical features for a calendar app
2,it was decent at first but it stops working completely when i wanted to put a custom time reminder and it did not sync with my google calendar i ended up deleting it 
2,this app is not free for even a trial so how am i going to buy it
2,i do not use it so i want to cancel the subscription but am unable jorte had unsubscribe within opening page unable to sign in
2,passcode feature is messed up and locked me out had to uninstall yr
2,i tried to explore it a little after downloading i want something that will show me everything planned on the day i have notes on rather than me having to search if i do i tend to forget due to busy schedules i want automatic pop up ill keep playing with it but so far dislike
2,the single franklincovey planner feature available is the task abc123 priorities system but oddly the task status system is missing no more fc system functionality as of the rest its a very conventional pim suite with a little of crm salt  pepper
2,well based on the description of this app and what i understood i would receive has not lived up to its description i hope the bugs will be worked out i emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far  it would be helpful to have a help andor faq section to refer to after only one day of using the app i have encountered the following  1 from calendar screen  button does not give option for project only event task or note  i have the upgraded version  2 settings general start with is set for day view but shows month instead  3 help  feedback only gives option to email for help no option to search for help  4 when deleting an item in a series comma i do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence  am i doing something wrong is there any help that i can expect to receive i paid 499 for the upgraded version and i am not at all happy busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app
2,i think the free version of the app has some good capabilities but lacks some functionality that i desire functionality that im not sure exists in the paid version due to the lack of support for the product i was unable to find where i could go to ask questions thus the 2 star rating
2,it doesnt work well as a calander or any type of memo for me i also didnt like the type of layout design they made it didnt fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do
2,used to love this app but after the update its dumb and no longer useful
2,the app does not sync with my google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option meetings etc are not shown and i have to go back to the google calendar or acalender to make sure i dont miss anything events made on my tablet do not show on my phone please fix this its such a great app if it just worked
2,it would be a 5 review if it werent yearly payment put it a one time payment and ill be the first one to buy it this really ruined it for me
2,free app is crippled version of paid app costs 499 a year
2,if you want to start a project you have to pay 499 a year
2,i try signing up logging in even with facebook and still wont even let me in
2,unable to create an account despite using email or social media account cant even start trying out the app
2,this thing is terrible i couldnt do anything i wanted
2,you want me to pay 5 for the full version so i can set a task to repeat my phones planner does that for free
2,it has deleted all of my entries planned for today i am going to try a new app
2,task notifications have stopped working
2,its still asking me in an ad on the app to upgrade  not cool
2,টযব হরইজনটল ফন ভরটকল ফল টযব লখত অসবধ হচছ এব লগ ইন করত হয যকন অযকউনট
2,wish i can repeat sirten things without spending  money every year
2,i installed because of the option to synch tasks but that is one of the features that unlocks for 499yr no issues paying it if i liked the feature but with no chance to try out the one reason i download the app i uninstalled immediately
2,very easy to pull me in i should have stopped but hindsight is always 2020 my friends and people who are interested in google apps for integrated coordination of tasks meetings whatever but what really gets my blood boiling and made me downgraded from 3 stars to 2 stars is the deadweight loss of not being able to either donate the rest of the subscription source capital investment that is just raining still if someone makes to make a donation is that im still sitting here with this deadweight loss
2,doesnt sync with google calendar the one thing its supposed to do and it failed
2,used to be good until last update now i cant login to see any of my tasks appointments or notes                                            edit now works since newest update but i have lost all previous tasks and notes very disappointed
2,need full version for anything more than a calender
2,what happened to all those data i had not able to log also
2,have used app for about 4 months now i cant get back into it keeps asking to sign in or create account wont let me do either time to dump it
2,was a great appbut could not loginsince last month sobye bye planner pro
2,it was working ok for a couple of months then would not let me sign in    funny thing is i dont remember signing out  i would simply hit the icon on my android and it would just be there  sure looks like it works for others
2,this app was everything i needed i loved it but after thenlast update i cannot log in to my account so i cannot see my daily schedule will not trust it again and i have already unistalled it i need an organizing app which i can trust fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt so i dont know if i am forgeting something that is pending now
2,i logged in with facebook i upgraded to the pro version checked the planner a day later and had to log in again now it says to upgrade to the pro version again and if i click it play says im already subscribed to it
2,every time the company upgrades the app or make any changes subscribers cant access the calendar sign in page has many issues
2,i put an event in and it doubles everyday fix the glitches this is a great app otherwise
2,at first i really liked it because all the systems are functioning well in my phone but when i used this in the tab the notifications wont even turn  i  sm really pissed by this and i hope you fix this asap
2,would not load
2,keeps telling me my email is invalid when its a normal gmail wont let me sign up
2,i went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isntyou have to buy the full version
2,it was great before but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes it doesnt notify according to schedule anymore and now it doesnt notify at all
2,the free version comes with ads and normally i would be okay with that except that it decides to interrupt you seemingly every minute to buy the full version now when planning your day you might have to schedule time to exit out of the constant ad popups
2,doesnt go to portrait
2,i really did not like the fact that when i set an exact time for stuff i can not sort to according to that so if i want to plan my day 10 am i have to do a 11 am i have to do b i can not sort it by time
2,when opening this app on my tablet nexus 7 2013 my screen goes to landscape  upon exiting the app the screen remains stuck in landscape  only way to fix is to turn tablet off and back on
2,has potential but you gotta pay
2,i was pretty pleased with the layout and the weekly view on the paid version but then i started encountering problems first of all i used fb to sign up and i logged out of the app and i can no longer sign in it stays loading indefinitely also on the weekly view it showed the incorrect name for the day and kept changing it it also changed notifications randomly
2,paid for the pro version and itbdoesnt seem to be working properly  appointments are not showing and sometimes double books contacted support took several days to get back to me and was still not helpful app is glitchy will not be renewing the subscription and going back to the old pencil and paper appointment tracking method  i cannot run my business with a faulty appointment app very disappointing
2,it was perfect for a personal planner  problem is i use google calender widget for business and this widget for personalwhat ever you select for one automatically sets for the other  was kinda hoping for two different planners here
2,norton antivirus reported this as a malicious app and recommended i uninstall after paying for the pro version i felt it was very lacking no portrait mode on tablet no day mode on phone no way to adjust the length of a meeting beyond that of the default meeting settings
2,5 for daily recurring tasks no thanks
2,it wouldnt sign me in at all and when i tryed to create an account it just stopped
2,im not going to create an account so uninstalled my tasks are private
2,this app worked well at first but it kept altering my entries no matter how many times i changed them not sure if its a problem just with syncing accounts
2,the ui is not attractive to begin with text overlap and the fact that the only screen orientation available is landscape immediately turned me off to the app the layout is not bad and puts all the information right in front of you but it looks as if it was built for windows 98 i certainly was not willing to pay for the full version when the free version was so flawed i can find better free apps with more functionality than the paid version of this one it needs some work
2,i already had bought the full version and now i have to pay again which is whatever but furthermore my calendar is missing most of the appointments and recurring events that i had before i just upgraded my phone to the htc10 from the lg g5 and i have none of my important calendar events now
2,suddenly need a subscription  after i had paid for a full version  and some of my calendars no longer work with the app  not impressed
2,i dont see the difference between this and google calender which already came with my phone
2,i found this difficult to use due to navigation love the home screen but its impossible to get back to it also the nonstop full screen ad to buy the app yearly is so annoying that alone makes it unusable if you make my free experience terrible why would i want to pay you
2,its supposed to be able to go on multiple devices yet when i downloaded to my phone after putting it on my tablet it just keeps saying loading after i spent a lot of time setting it up and plugging in all my appointments for the next month its a huge disapointment should i get fixed i will change rating to a 5star
2,it does not give me the ability to not use 24hr time format im not in the military or a factory so i prefer regular time format doesnt matter how many times i uncheck the 24hr setting it sticks fix that and ill rate higher and maybe even purchase a yr subscription
2,wouldnt let me make reoccurring events without an upgrade
2,i liked the layout for the most part except being forced into landscape mode in the app the glitch was that when adding something to the calendar a box would come up for datetime but cut off the calendar and clock thats necessary to select datetime there was no way to even input manually it would work great if you only had to enter something for whichever date you were on and a specific one hour period set a half an hour after the time on your device very disappointing
2,i did my update and everything i had programmed and saved on this app is gone ive lost all important dates information and reminders for the entire year well done guys
2,this app wouldnt up date my schedule only some postings would transfer to my employees phones and i couldnt be positive something actually worked unless i checked to make sure twice i even bought the pro version not happy
2,i did like it until you updated and took the good features away lame
2,on the pictures it shows you things that are only on the paid version
2,i liked the version before the update where it had blocks to show the event thats the only reason why i downloaded it and now it got rid of it
2,changes and cancellations do not get updated on the widget secondly it is not possible to scroll between months  easily
2,it just says it failed or something like that might work for you though
2,it wasnt everything i thought it would be
2,i loved this app when i tried the free version the side tabs and all it felt like a planner then i open it up and it mustve updated because the looks changed no side tabs so i paid for the pro version to get more out of it nothing has changes i go to landscape view and it wont scroll its glitch to i have paid the 499 and it keeps telling me to upgrade ive already paid i emailed you guys and still havent heard any support a week later so my advice to you all keep your 5
2,i was happy with all the things with this app until i got up to find all my appointments were gone
2,its buggy when going back and forth between different views  switching from events to tasks etc also tasks widget doesnt work because it will show all tasks completed tasks also included id try to check the box to mark it completebut it would bring me to edit the task monthly widget cant even be placed on my screen it says there is not enough room its a new slate im trying to put it on
2,the app always stops i had to restart my tab to make it work or try to open so many times
2,seems to be extremely buggy couldnt work out how to use the app for what i wanted so i subscribed for more features that i would use app keeps telling me to purchase but then errors saying im already subscribed complicated and broken if app updates then so will this review side note  portrait view for tablet would be very appreciated tablet is only 7 inches and portrait is easier to type on whilst standing at work
2,it was awesome the first week  now unless i upgrade and pay it locks up and constant request to pay for upgrade not free
2,i could not set the time to cover more than an hour difference between start and finish and if i change the finish time it would reset the start time to what i changed the finish time to
2,dont like how it automatically syncs with gmail and calender
2,please can l use this for my boss appointment s
2,screenshots clearly show a weekly view but this isnt available unless you buy the full version for 349
2,good looking app but got on the companys website to see what other integrationsplatform downloads were available no downloads available on their site site is very sparse and lacking real support info get on their facebook and see copious complaints about everything from people being double billed to glitches on various apps theyve created the clencher for me was that they were blatantly ignoring these comments and replies and continued posting links about their apps nope uninstalling
2,has some unchangeable unfeatures like not showing appointments marked with other than default privacy as well as appointments marked as available  instead of busy thats all work hours i have set apart for clients but not allocated yet  important information to me
2,very good design but will not sync across phone tablet windows nicely if they fix it i would like to go back
2,there are lots better calendartask tracking apps out there  calengoo to name just one
2,first there is no dark theme second there is no portrait mode for tablets
2,would be great but this app has 31 days in february this year it throws off everything for the rest of the year
2,task sync with google calendar not working
2,all my tasks except current day disappeared  still available on google calendar fortunately
2,pop up reminder not showing for scheduled events
2,i like to look at this at the start but then it wouldnt even show the correct date when you open up in the morning
2,i really have loved this app but it has lately been bugging out on me even though it is up to date it wont let me view certain days at all it will just take me to the day before or the same date in a different month if i try clicking on it it only started for the past week or two
2,no way to jump ahead in month view  if you need to enter an event thats two months out its a pain to do  i uninstalled it
2,will not allow me to click on certain dates if i click on june 18 it only goes to june 17
2,pretty but hollow no google tasks integration so why bother widgets like most other apps are too simple to be useful need to be able to control widget row height text sizes and content
2,im using a tablet where its only available in landscape orientation just not for me i think
2,this app has issues with keeping my events and tasks saved  also the widget does not update on a daily basis  if it worked like it should then this app would be amazing because the overall appearance of it is quite good  unfortunately there isnt much use in having a planner that doesnt save your information properly
2,i would like to tap on the times i want to do something as oppose to going through the new event button
2,it only notifies you once or twice then it doesnt notify you again
2,on some point stopped showing calendar items waste of time
2,guess it doesnt sync tasks from google calendar
2,ive just downloaded this and i cant figure out how to set the same tasks to reaccre every day without having to type it in over and over  is there a way to do this if so can someone help me plz
2,idk it is kk
2,when i put any task in a certain day it says that planner stopped and not working
2,didnt work well on my devise probably because its an android
2,i installed the app because it had all the features i used in my paper planner once i installed the app and began using the widget calendar the numbers and saved  events disappeared when i powered my note 4 off and turned it back on
2,no reminders notifications
2,bought full version then got a refund  it wont sync
2,i love this app but the widgets arent working at all im stuck on yesterday and neither the month nor the day widget arrows work please fix its really frustrating and troublesome since i rely on planner a lot
2,i felt really disappointed to find it did not look as shown the week view is only available in the paid version
2,have to pay for the upgrade and everything is unclear feel like it wasnt as simple as it should of been need to change the app make it better please
2,need to pay for such feature  else should be perfect for a planner usage
2,it looked decent app but uses cpu too much makes phone run hot even with android 511
2,basic
2,looks like a nice app but i immediately went to do my settings the latest your day can end is midnight i work at night and my day ends at 5am cant use this app if i cant program all my stuff 
2,keeps crashing every time i try to use it
2,good app need to be able to synch with google calendar
2,this has many of the same features of the schedule app i already use but is missing some key features i see the paid version will allow me to repeat tasks but will it allow me to make drag and drop adjustments to my schedule if so then it would be worth the investment and a better review
2,everytime i try to open an event it stops and closes out
2,it is a great app but i am deleting it because it keeps resetting my clock preference it keeps adding the email accounts i keep telling it not to and it hardly ever notifies me when its supposed to
2,cant sync with google calendar
2,i loved it until i realized that the very feature that got me to download it in the first place is only available in the upgraded version i agree that some features should only be available if you upgrade but the weekly view really only planner that weekly view isnt part of the free app
2,gave it a test run and tried out the notifications didnt hear a thing also doesnt save new calenders bugs perhaps im not sure cant say i be upgrading
2,looks great but since installing my device only lasts half as long before needing a recharge it appears to be constantly doing stuff in the background which uses battery power ive never seen an app so busy shame
2,this app looked good until i had to purchase it just to get the week view now everytime i choose week view it crashes and stops working i want a refund or a fix
3,cant load past notes it does work sometimes but i cant figure out how to get it to work
3,i would have rwnewed my annual subscriptuon if they had provided sync with windows laptop
3,can be better for self organising
3,i like this app but sometimes it just closes and anything you were doing is not saved very annoying and it happens on all 3 of my devices so i dont think it is a problem with the device
3,not bad wish it happens the option for more tabs for notes
3,works with my google calendars and has nice planner features i gave it only three stars because i cannot change my calendar colors i can change the colors in settings but the first time planner updates the calendars change back to the default colors i also paid for the original incarnation of this calendar that they abandon and went to this subscription based one the version i had eventually stopped functioning as android updated i do not trust paying for this after that experience
3,its a great app but i wish you guys would arrange tasks based on their set time instead of be prioritizing them
3,the app has been good for showing my calendar and daily notesjournal on the same screen i would like it much better if there was a backuprestore option and if it was available across devices and platforms i had to reset my phone recently and lost most of my daily notes i have the pro version but will be canceling my subscription
3,use to track work things
3,ive been using it for a while and really find it useful but it duplicates the tasks which is pretty annoyingi suddenly have to exercise 6 times a day xdi guess that could be benefitialbut no its annoying really xd will be glad to give it 5 stars once that stops happening
3,really like the app however it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear frustraring not using it right now
3,good app however the notification has stopped working
3,the app design looks nice and has good features this is a functional planner app i can access the week view in the free version though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version this is a main feature im looking for in a planner app also the look of the app cannot be customized stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen there are other free apps that include these things
3,i would give this app 5 stars but i am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open i pay the subscription for premium and i love all the options in the app but it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open unless there is a notification in my notification bar that i can open the app with this would be annoying even with a free app but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous in the 2 or 3 years that ive used it this has never been fixed with any upgrade
3,g o o d
3,this is hands down the best personal planning app ive ever come across that being said its basically unusable on android the view jumps to the top of the days task list at random making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task it takes minutes to load anything when you try to access the rest of the app through the back arrow at the top left and on occasion tasks will duplicate themselves multiple times with different parameters i use it on my ipad with no trouble at all
3,app is extremely useful just that the search feature doesnt cover all the notes in the app
3,great app intuitive navigation easy to use nice integration with other apps whats up with the lavender color designation i didnt think that lavender would look turquoise
3,useful app interface are easy to use would be better if you could add search function so we dont have to comb thru everything to find what we are looking for
3,i like how it allows me to set any number of reminders minuteshoursdaysweeks in advance either by push notification or email but many little bugs pepper this app the calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time the location field tries to be smart by giving you a maps like autocomplete but this is annoying when you just want gym for some reason the first letter of an event name isnt registered by autocorrect so event turns to venting
3,its actually good but it doesnt have a feature where your task appears on your lockscreen that will remind you everytime you forgot something to do
3,does not update tasks in widget automatically
3,i need more time with your app im looking for an organizing app to meet the needs of me and my gaming community to be able to cross schedule events share valuable information waarach while i know that was never your vision i am impressed with the very easy to use ui but have not figured out if u can share projects notes calandars ect i cam see your app meeting a very large need in a community the desperately needs an easy way to collaborate adding a groups feature to cross plan 5 stars
3,bought the planner pro love the app the down side is that the app did not sync i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android i have to update both device twice instead of once would give 4 or 5 star if it can sync between both device i have some suggestion maybe can input some bill tracker and some cute icon or pill tracker hydration icon
3,landscape mode only big problem cant make it portrait on my kindle fire 8
3,why wont my homescreen widget display all day events this makes it really difficult to use
3,like the concept but tech support cannot get rid of ads and popups tried over several months but they are gone a short while then return the response lag and language issues are frustrating this changed my review and i removed the app
3,i love this app its the only one that looks and feels like the old franklin planner however since the latest update i have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with google ads and i am a paid pro user this is extremely annoying if they dont remove this im leaving
3,i like this app but the ads are getting aggravating especially the trump ads id prefer not to see him on my phone thank you very much
3,i found this app to be redundant since i already have a calendar on my phone and planner pro does little else
3,there are ads even though there wasnt any label of contains ads in this app description
3,it works it just hard
3,like everything about the app except my events kept disappearing i would enter an event and one would disappear
3,i have the app on my phone and my ipad and they do not communicate everything that i input on my phone i have to reinput on my ipad im signed into the same account on both it would be nice if they would communicate also i dont understand why the computer app is available separately and for a much more expensive price
3,theres a visible lag when scrolling left or right in day view even in high end phones going back from a task edit screen without making any changes also asks shows popup whether you wish to save or discard changes that popup is irritating otherwise an effective and the point app cheers
3,"not able to sync with outlook cannot create goals with a goal tracker or 
export calendar events tasks or notes and only accessible through phone 
and tablet much improvements needed for such a high subscription rate"
3,"its good but since we always have more than 1 thing to do we write three 
or more things to do and when we go to priorities exc1 a4 b2 etc we 
wouldnt know which to do so we suggest you have more of those thanks"
3,its a nice app it make my life displined
3,been using for a while now getting buggy needs update
3,would be awesome except when i put start in weekly view in the settings i can no longer access monthly view or change the settings 
3,didnt realize this synced to my outlook calendar started deleting work stuff and deleted two important appointments from my work calender im screwed on those was planning on using this for personal use only
3,when i tried putting inmy class scheduel they kept vanishing when i add notes to a specific date it might work fine if you dont need many events but its a pain if you have a lot to keep track of
3,it have future if they make notes can be organize by category tasks can create sub task and fix bug when samsung dex enabled
3,i downloaded this app on my tablet long time ago full version and recently also downloaded it on my phone as i dont bring my tablet with me all the time i only use the task function because  my  calendar events do not sync properly i havent fpnd the sync button on my phone and another not so funny thing for me i am using the same account for both devices but i cant use the full version on my phone i get a message that i need to buy it  thats why i need to use my tablet with the full version on it if i want to add something
3,i love this app but it sucks that i can only use it on my phone id give it a 5 if i could a use a desktop version of the app as well b sync tasks with wunderlist  and c  sync reminders from google calendar as tasks on planner pro
3,great app but it keeps deleting the events birthdays etc that i put in it ive never had this problem before please do something this is my goto calendar app and id hate to have to find a different one
3,wont do recurring tasks does not connect to gtasks as shown in the cover photo hasnt been updated in a long time
3,it is ok
3,guys excellent app bad financial model prepared to pay reluctant about  subscription model unfortunately uninstall
3,cant wait to try it
3,loved it except that it wouldnt save and show me all of my events
3,just downloaded this appnot sure what i think of it at the momentcant seem to find where you can use colours like the pictures
3,it says i changed my password and now cant get in calendar what can i do to fix problems
3,i like it but when i put my pass code in to access it  i goes through but then it says your password has been changed please sign in but i have to hit the back button on my phone to ignore it so it doesnt make me sign in again  but when i do hit ok for it to let me sign in again my password isnt there  its still locked but i dont know the password
3,ill like it more if i can the way i view this apps difficult for me to type in landscape position
3,so so i expected the ability to attach files to notes and a lot more flexibility with format
3,plz help it says m typing wrong passcode it is not opening with my old passcode
3,the aap good but not some updates are required such as  in notes section add photo upload option add journal option
3,nice layout but it will not sync repaired events between my tablet and phone i contacted tech support but they were unresponsive and not helpful i do not recommend
3,forever landscape why cant i ever get this app to rotate to portrait mode its never been able to do this even after downloading it on other phones way too annoying to have to deal with for me to deem it a useful app at least for me
3,its fairly easy to use however the alarm  doesnt  work
3,overall great organization tool however recent updates make the application only usable in horizontal view which is extremely annoying and quite an inconvenience
3,the event didnt sync to my other device
3,love the app and bought the full version in february but recently it quit syncing between my phone and my tablet i emailed support about the issue on june 2 the tasks are syncing now but calendar items still are not syncing  wish they would fix the issue
3,this app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save
3,i liked the app and it looked like it had a good set of features but i didnt like the 499year recurring subscription fee
3,task repeat options are garbage for basic things its ok but dont expect more than that
3,helpful but not too much
3,i liked the app well enough to pay for it so i could get my recurring items in order with it but when i set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that i started with
3,it worked great to start with but now im not getting task notifications and some of my events are not showing up on my calendar widget
3,i like this app very much because its fairly easy to use and it allows for actual ring tones to be used not just notification tones however my biggest issues are that i cannot receive any notifications from the planner if the event was created on my phones calendar im assuming this is the issue since only half or less than half of my total events and tasks do not sound it also will not sound when i have reminders set for many different times its original default reminder is 15 minutes before the event time but i changed it to be on time and then i would make other reminders if need be it will only sound at 15 minutes before the event time no matter what i tell it to do
3,im using this app for work for due diligence when i first installed the app i was sure i could search my notes for key words now i cant am i doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app
3,it does not have the ending time of an event
3,how can i take the notes i have made and copy them over to my laptop i have looked to see where the notes save to but cant seem to find them anywhere please help me
3,whenever i open it i have to turn my phone sideways because its locked in horizontal even after i turn on auto rotate
3,good app that i can use for putting all my appointments in one problem is that the notifications i set to make sure it reminds me dont go off at all i have a droid turbo 2 if you guys could fix that i will change to 5 stars
3,hello developers can you please help i put a passcode on the app and now it wont let me access the calender it keeps telling me that my passcode is incorrect when i know i put it in correctly please fix this
3,no matter what i do even setting no notifications when creating event or task they  continually pop up not happy with this feature
3,a good app overall but the new version no longer shows the duration of events which is extremely annoying and a deal breaker for me
3,i love the app except that the widget does not remember customizations such as default calendar not using 24 hour time if this could be more flexible and keep the settings of the apps i would definitely rate five stars its helped save time having multiple uses for one app but i need the widget compatibility
3,the app no longer notifies me of my tasks please fix
3,it doesnt work well for repeated scheduling of regular tasks  i have tried selecting every week or every 7 days and repeat either does not work at all or shows up only for the same day monthly not weekly
3,i love it so far but is it usable over multiple devices i am currently using it on my tablet and downloaded the app to my phone but when i try to sign in it says it cant find my email address
3,try
3,not being able to view my list of things to do or to get
3,setting up late events past 11pm is literally impossible start and end timesdays will shift randomly when i make a change to the other  whenever i do manage to get both right i get a same time error even though clearly the start and end times are different
3,i had several recurring events to keep track of my week but after the update they disappeared
3,good design but its not exactly free if you have to pay for basic features like reoccurring events
3,i purchased the paid version and im sort of disappointed every time i enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so i have to change it each time ie it will autocorrect to eevery instead of every it is also kind of laggy it could be a great app but not as is
3,i suggest you add a deadline button instead of just tasks and events personally thats the only reason i dont use it is the classifications arent enough
3,needed  sync tasks color code events and for goodness sake speed up this is extremely slow
3,its really unresponsive i have to tap 3 times so something opens or to check a box or anything  too bad i really liked it but this is too annoying
3,the app is making me sign in to an account but wont  let me sign in frustrated
3,the reviews are sending a clear message to you act on them i think the last update has messed everyone up if you dont actyoure sending a message backie you meant to mess everyone up by locking them out
3,this planner app is pretty clear and simple i have the paid version and it works ok except today they had a glitch and i lost everything even when i reinstalled it was just so screwed up  so if you dont mind losing all of your work when they update i guess its survivable
3,add ability to have a dark theme
3,troublesome widget organization when i tap a date it opens app to date previously open not new date needed very time consuming and creates booking mistakes when not careful
3,love it but it has some major flaws 1 cant personalize theme 2 cant configurate widgets toolbars  what details are displayed 3 the widgets size is too widemax 4x would love it if it were more flexible 4 you cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in alphabetical order on the day widget it will always be sorted by time 5 the app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen 6 app stops working a lot for seemingly no reason
3,enjoyed its use while it lasted uninstalled now
3,cant make calls from the app by clicking on the phone number like google calendar
3,pro version and it still wont handle the recurring tasks smoothly please fix it ive restarted my phone several times and still nothing
3,the app would be nice and work well if it wasnt for this 1 issue but its a pretty big issue as far as daily planners goit only shows half of a clock or calender in the create eventtask subscreen meaning i can not select any times that would fall on the right hand side of the clock or i can not select a due by date  for tasks because the right side of the calender is missingi would already own the full version if it wasnt for this problem
3,crashing a lot after update
3,уууу
3,i just got the app but i can barely use it because every time i click on something it redirects me to a page that asks me to upgrade for 499yr if it would just let me use the free version i might actually like it
3,this application was exactly what i needed when i first started to use it now there are a handful or problems events are appearing twice events get deleted or  not appearing at all after being saved deleting one event and the reoccurring events get deleted and not appearing on the selected reoccurring days very annoying
3,fix the widget bugs please
3,not a bad app pretty good got a few things organized with it
3,theres nothing wrong with this app although it could be slightly better but its just like google calendar in fact its integrated with google calendar and all your events show up in gc even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same if youre an android user go ahead and just use the built in google calendar if not your samsunghtcwhatever one i have near stock android so i get google  same difference really
3,overall good a search feature would be great for notes thanks
3,i used to love the app until i needed to synchronise to see my tasks to another device then i found out syncing simply wont work and uninstallingreinstalling didnt solve the issue
3,i bought this because it has a really design and features but i to uninstall it because its slow loading its lagging
3,have to go premium to have more features
3,trying to sync my calendar with both my phone and tablet and any notes andor tasks are not syncing between my devices  having to duplicate these items is very frustrating
3,i love it but too expensive
3,the only thing not working is the reminder im using huawei mate8 can somebody help me how
3,why did you show the checkboxes in widget when you cant even checkuncheck it via the widget its just so frustrating to go to the app just to check a list other than that this app is good
3,needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking if it had this option would be excellent otherwise not a bad app
3,i use it mainly for its widgets one thing though please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and dont stay put on the previous day unless manually changed
3,just getting used to it but so far not bad
3,a bit disappointed  bought a new phone and redownload ed the app would not bring my calander in from my old phone and asking me to repay for the full version
3,but i miss the hourly blocks made it easy to sceduale my work hours
3,it doesnt update between your calanders i need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes this is not it  waste of money
3,it is an ok app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name time and place can not count on it to keep you informed about set calender events though as they are set default in 2014 mothers day was on the 8th 2nd sunday in may this year not wednesday the 11th they can thank my wife for keeping me informed it is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be keep an accurate calendar handy
3,why would i pay money to have recurring events in a planner i think ill stick with my default calander app
3,love this planner but whenever i use the repeat function i cant just edit 1 event i have to edit the rest of the events that are linked together too would be great if im able to edit jus 1 event even when im using the repeat function would also be great if theres a copy and paste of events function would make things really easier 
3,good integration with other calanders but not easy to read at a glance
3,dont have option for windows surface pro
3,bills 
3,font is too small  you have to open it up each time you want to glance at your appointments
3,hodtf coder jbikhkhkm kvukb
3,its ok but it needs more features
3,sometimes quits as it starts
3,needs more features but i just started using it so ill let u know specifics soon
3,could be better on samsung s6 not showing reminders on screen have to open the same as a diary
3,i bought the allegedly better version it worked for about a month i had all my scheduled stuff about 6 months and all of a sudden the disappeared which sucks
3,i prefer to use apps in portrait mode on my 7 inch phonetablet huawei mediapad x2 19201200 when the keyboard pops up while adding a task i can barely see what im typing because the screen height is greatly reduced in landscape
3,i really liked it at first but it keeps turning on the alarm for my events even though i pressed no alarm i dont know how many times 
3,wouldnt it be great if this app had also alerts instead of just notifications its easy to miss a notofication also why cant we edit a specific day for a repeated event but we have to edit also all future events or nothing
4,simple  feel like paper planner
4,helpful with notes and events no restrictions to enter everything like appointments
4,so far i like it very much i use it daily and it helps me stay organized and focused
4,very efficient love it
4,works pretty good for what i need it for i was looking for a franklin day planner look but this comes up on the day i put the reminder on in my calendar so it is helpful its working for me as a partial retired person
4,so far it is working only just started using
4,its ok i have this app for several years i dont like the advertisements
4,i love this app a couple of suggestions 1 for the repeat function i wish it had more flexibility such as an end date since i am a visual person i would love it if the task list had color associated with the level of importance but i do love this app so much that i upgraded
4,excellent application wouldve given 5 stars if the following want such a pain would like for it to be easier to remove a recurring event however that seems to be an incredible pain otherwise i would recommend this app to everyone who is most comfortable with a realistic planner feel with a futuristic spin on it definite thumbs up 
4,happy with it
4,premium user here and im enjoying the app so far ive had a hard time replacing an old app mypoli and this one seems to fit the bill its quite buggy at this stage and has limited features but functionality is great i can see myself using it for the next 6months1year hopefully the devs keep improving the app
4,i like the app but the user interface could be polished the seems slightly delayed a new look would be nice but over all a helpful app would still recommend
4,really like this app wish syncing across android and ios was easier but i have looked and no other app has the style and versatility of planner pro well done planner pro folk
4,great app really needs a desktop capability
4,does it work in a laptop on the web
4,ok for a notepad but not the most ideal if u like to be organized 
4,so far works great
4,i like the fact that i can put everything i need to do on the task list and it stays there forever but then i have a small widget that just shows me what i am focused on in the moment so it is not overwhelming i also like being able to prioritize my tasks in the a b and c categories it is also good to be able to sync my calendars with my familys but sometimes when i turn to the calendar it has trouble displaying the multiple appointments especially if they overlap
4,this is a decent app for keeping track events and appointments
4,the ease of use for everyday things is great i have a note pad task pad and calendar and i just set a task to call back a customer after hrs sure it might note be a flashy business planner but if you just want something to remind you of events store something quickly for later reference what more do you need so far any ads havent been intrusive the main reason people stop using these kind of apps
4,any chance of getting a widget for the calendar love the dark mode
4,doesnt replace my default calendar but does have extra features that take it from calendarscheduler to planner great product
4,would be nice to have the ability to add more tabs
4,good app to use ive been bullet journaling by hand but moving back to digital and this was the best i found to transition early days but so far so good
4,good help
4,good planner apps
4,very good reminder
4,i would subscribe in the app if it supports righttoleft languages such as arabic when i switch my mobile to arabic the text in the widgets mix up with buttons
4,i have been using this app for years what l especially like is the simplicity of use
4,easy to use app allows me to keep track of my busy schedule
4,i like the app i use the weekly planner widget thw most so it is easier to get organized it syncs with google calendar the only reason i am not giving it a 5 stars is becauae after an update it stopped updating the week on my screen and i have to search for the right week everytime
4,if youre familiar with stephen coveys product suite youll find this tool to be an essential time management companion the interface is similar to the paper based system the application provides fields for tasks events etc there are supporting priority and notification features aiding in the arrangement and alerting of tasks the application would benefit from improvements with the synchronization of tasks across multiple devices
4,easy to navigate
4,good interface but recent tech issues app slow to open
4,just using basic to track milage works fine
4,i like the app and use it for everything my one complaint is the search mechanism does not always work i would like it to show all items that match the search request
4,i love that the app interface is so easy to use the reason i dont give it 5 stars is because you cant export notes it would be ideal if that could be done
4,im using 2 calenders and 1 to do planner not including this all has their pros and functions i want yet theyre different in style this is one of the best i just love using the week view seeing at one shot time of events laid out in planner including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed it sync with my anydo planner which has a calender but i just love how i can use this a bit differently for scheduling best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function
4,this is the only app that does what it does and i love the functionality the only problem is the app is quite buggy and i havent seen or noticed any updates in years would also be nice if there was a website to go with it i am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks if google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better that would do it all
4,great app i would rate it a 5 but theres an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and its annoying
4,i had a problem with upgrading to premium they were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away its a good app for those familiar with the franklin covey system and syncs well across devices
4,after purchasing the pro version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now i have grown to truly love it it mimicks as close to the franklin covey planners to any app out there i have found and this is what has drawn me to it i am increasing my rating to 4 stars because i have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and i love that it will sink with my google calendar and other calendars i love this app i only wish it could print
4,osm osm osm osm
4,great app and the only flaw i see is that you cant yet export your data please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so i can save my entries forever
4,so far the best planner app i ever come across room for improvement ie to be accessible on pc as if some other app does
4,events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them other times a certain day will not be selectable choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesnt seem to work
4,i love this app i have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized however only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices
4,it is what i have looked for for some time i wish it could syncd across multiple devices
4,i wish i could create notes without having to select a date otherwise so far so nice 
4,i do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin needs to keep developing but in the theme its in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss its position
4,better to have a search option for notes
4,very easy to use have all i need
4,"i would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasnt obscured 
i dont mind the week number or anything i just wish i could see both it 
and the bottom of the calendar clearly"
4,it takes time burpt good but it keeps getting out like you cant login
4,"i dont quite get the categories for tasks i hope there is an option to 
hide it or remove it"
4,"this app would be so much more useful to me if i could order tasks by time 
hope you guys can fix this thank you great app good job"
4,"cool app seems to have all i need at this point my only 2c would be that 
the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead 
rather than the current week if its a friday i dont really care what i 
did on monday i wanna know whats happening next monday"
4,"just a couple of things  i dont like the fact that the reminders show 
up multiple times and i wish it had a to do list but other than that  
but other than that so far so good"
4,just installed and am liking it so far i do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar also sub tasks would be very useful with those changes i might actually be able to downsize the apps i use
4,i just need notification  tone more than these and much more long
4,seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account would give you 5 stars if fixed
4,havent found how to sync between two devices yet
4,things were going great until i switched to a new phone i cant find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone i installed the app in my new phone and logged in but the data is not there  i see that the events comes from the google calendar and i may be able to do something about that  but how do i sync the tasks  pls help
4,great user interface easy to use syncing with google calendar is a huge advantage from todo lists to events you can schedule anything
4,i love this app  i have always been a franklin covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner  great search function
4,i really like this app for the most part but i really dont like how the month view inapp and on the widget dont actually list out what you have on that day just colored dots would really like to be able to have this since i paid for the pro version please consider
4,i like this app it has a lot of the features i use all in one place however even though it lists all my google calendars i cant figure out how to do anything with them i have projects spread over a dozen calendars but i cant seem to add anything to any of them
4,its pretty good
4,nice apps but need to re download the full version
4,great app but would be good if you could edit tasks after youve written them  also would be good if it could have a daily things to do listoncalendar which could be ticked off alongside projects tasks
4,overall a good app but i would also like the option of switching from landscape view
4,add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it love it
4,great very usefull please add fitur search to find an old note
4,a great app i just downloaded it and i already love it the only issue here is slight ui bugs november 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout again great app but those errors make the app look less professional i would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar definitely am recommending to friends though
4,good enaught
4,the perfect planneronly thing missing is that remimder is not working
4,this app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as its annoying the app will opened up when i pressed the box to tick what ive completed everytime
4,i think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg
4,i would like to be able to import my contacts to it i would give 5 stars for that
4,the essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection its about progress this application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments senior project engineer here it really helps alot thank you
4,i really like this app  its a lovely interface simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar is there any possibility of adding a foldertagcategory function to the notes  it would be so helpful  i make notes on a varietu of things as i go along and its really useful to be able to store them by day but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders anyway  just a suggestion otherwise a lovely app thanks 
4,awesome app it helps me a lot to organize my life work and other stuffs the features are really amazing would recommend this to my friends and colleagues
4,almost perfect the only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list and i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories also i wish that you had a rollover option for tasks i have yet to find an app that had this basically i wish when i create a task i could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not
4,i went a got the full subscription and i really like it so far but i wish you could download it for your pc as well
4,its cool
4,i just downloaded this  the free version was definitely useful but i went ahead and got the paid version because i wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well  i definitely think this will be worth the purchase
4,i really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading if i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee give me a break 5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year yall are greedy
4,this app is great but i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app for example something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show due soon instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning
4,great app    help  i unfortunately forgot my password i was very sure its correct but im not sure why it says its wrong is there anything that can be done about it
4,this is a great planner app only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees
4,the app was working fine until i removed google now now the widgets will not show on home page
4,planned not bad
4,this is the app which i use for almost a year there is one issue i have faced recently namely some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where i installed the app im using this app on my android smartphone as well as on ipad i would be very pleased if you fix it
4,greatly improved comment from me  much better than a year ago  most updated lead to improvement  wish the  want an annual subscription
4,its 
4,almost all the functionality of the franklin planner this is a great app
4,the calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful
4,this is a simple app that gives me the capability of creating a todo list set event on my calendar and take notes
4,its a really great app
4,if only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due so if i created 5 events to go off in an hr ill have 5 icons piled up on my fone its not needed or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they dont want it
4,this planner pro is very nice and better for you time schedule
4,awesome app wish had auto sort feature of priority task like franklin planner use to have
4,works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small google pixel recurring error
4,nice app but can update a function such as we can add in an attachmentlike photo into the task or etc will be better
4,would have given it 5 stars but it doesnt seem to want to rotate when using my tablet
4,very helpful the best yet 
4,i like the app very helpful for lots of things however ive lost my account twice ive had to uninstall it and recreate my account very good otherwise tho
4,i loved this app worked so great i purchased it now it has logged me out and says i dont exist
4,i dont know it works good and i like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful i just kind of would like to have a better weekly view but all in all it gets the job done
4,like it a little even bought the pro version but when i went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone
4,i love this app and has been using it for more than a year but lately it has bugs which changes the days when i opened it perdays please fix it
4,its a nice planner i just prefer a different layout i also dont care for the color
4,i just installed this gem of an app this morning and love its ease of use however there is a minor problemthe date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar
4,great app and easy to use would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect that arent just for the day
4,its generally good but screen rotation doesnt work so i cant use this app upside down in galaxy tab10 if this problem isnt solved i wont pay for the next year it would be great if this problem is solved
4,it is helpful
4,love the layout and automatic carryover of tasks to next day    one problem  i have installed planner pro on my ipad and my android phone  the calendar events and tasks cannot be synced between my two devices  very frustrated  please add this sync feature soon
4,however there are a few bugs every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and i have to delete it the synchronization with drop box isnt good enough to use on two devices i would be useful if you could choose third sunday of every month for recurring tasks
4,good for studying
4,i like this app and use it on my android phone and ios ipad its easy to use dont need to buy anything and is clear i dont love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isnt how i expected but its a good app
4,havent been using this app for long but it seems great so far i love that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day i just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes that would make this a 5star review
4,would love to be able to customize the app more  need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view
4,a today button would be helpful in the week view widget so that you dont have to scroll back and also the possibility to add more accounts are these features available in the pro version maybe the possibility to try it  for a short period of time
4,i liked it but is there a widget for the app
4,gud for organised businessman
4,app
4,thanks
4,good features n easy to use
4,plan daily schedule
4,this is what i have been finding 
4,why on earth when im on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default just why
4,this is one of my favorite apps
4,takes a while to get used to could also use a daily reminder setting option
4,nettymac
4,i love all the features but its still missing an events widget to show on the main screen like the task widget the planner gives me a feeling like it doesny care about events it doesny have notification for it or a list out for it  is it possible to add the feature
4,it was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and i am unable switch the day
4,this application is very useful in helping keep me organized and paced the only suggestion id make is on the interface when checking off my tasks for the day the add new task button is in the way of pressing the cross off button its a bit annoying but i love this app
4,i am the most unorganized person ever and this app has helped me a lot i constantly put down when my projects tests etc are due i even include my days off on it i also love that you can not down little notes with this app as well
4,user friendly and plenty of bells and whistles  
4,app shuts down somtimes
4,can you add time in notes also like events
4,its really good
4,only thing i dont like is that when creating a recurring event the date doesnt show on the monthly view until you scroll over to the actual week of the event it would be a lot better if i could see those dates on the monthly view without having to scroll fix please for 5 star rating
4,i finally found a easy functional planner that reminds me with a message perfectly timed im a set it and forget it planner that plans a month out the messages keep me on task its tasks function is fluid enough that personal tasks can be added between as needed
4,extremely easy to use and exactly what i was looking for love the widget for this planner as well i just wish the interface was a bit more aesthetically pleasing like a bit more sleekmodern
4,helped me a lot to plan my workband stay organized i recommend it
4,easy
4,5 stars if it were completely free 
4,thanks for calander maker to hv realised that notes are necessary with task and calander then also necessary to hv online backup of those what hv been done not only the calander syncits already well synced

4,i like it works well if you are use to the franklin time management system
4,useful apps
4,i paid for this application on my ipad now i am asked to pay for it on my android to get the same features why do i have to pay twice for the same app i hope the developers respond to me
4,i loved the app but had to delete it because i couldnt choose which calendars i wanted to sync
4,will be 5 stars if it can be backed up via cloud
4,easy to use  i like being able to add sub tasks and notes  still new to using it though
4,have only used it a little so far but really like it  busy with doctors appointments for mum going through the cancer journey  allows me to put in multiple appointments in the one day and add notes  would have given it 5 stars but i am way too new to this to say that it is without fault
4,very practical but a bit sluggish
4,it connects to your phone calendar so its very useful for having more space to put notes and tasks
4,it is a nice and handy app to manage ur work

4,it helped so much
4,this app help me with my time management and staying organized
4,love this app     only thing that bothers me is that when i put repeat on events it only works sometimes  so just make sure it actually fills in the reoccurring days that you choose
4,i like more the design and how the calendar features are displayed on a same screen
4,i search diligently for an help to help me structure my time with the hope that it would improve my productivity i found it with this planner it really helps me to manage my time and stay focus on the assigned tasks or events
